FOREWORD


IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE EVERHARD MANUSCRIPT IS AN IMPORTANT
HISTORICAL DOCUMENT  TO THE HISTORIAN IT BRISTLES WITH ERRORSNOT
ERRORS OF FACT  BUT ERRORS OF INTERPRETATION  LOOKING BACK ACROSS THE
SEVEN CENTURIES THAT HAVE LAPSED SINCE AVIS EVERHARD COMPLETED HER
MANUSCRIPT  EVENTS  AND THE BEARINGS OF EVENTS  THAT WERE CONFUSED AND
VEILED TO HER  ARE CLEAR TO US  SHE LACKED PERSPECTIVE  SHE WAS TOO
CLOSE TO THE EVENTS SHE WRITES ABOUT  NAY  SHE WAS MERGED IN THE EVENTS
SHE HAS DESCRIBED 

NEVERTHELESS  AS A PERSONAL DOCUMENT  THE EVERHARD MANUSCRIPT IS OF
INESTIMABLE VALUE  BUT HERE AGAIN ENTER ERROR OF PERSPECTIVE  AND
VITIATION DUE TO THE BIAS OF LOVE  YET WE SMILE  INDEED  AND FORGIVE
AVIS EVERHARD FOR THE HEROIC LINES UPON WHICH SHE MODELLED HER HUSBAND 
WE KNOW TODAY THAT HE WAS NOT SO COLOSSAL  AND THAT HE LOOMED AMONG THE
EVENTS OF HIS TIMES LESS LARGELY THAN THE MANUSCRIPT WOULD LEAD US TO
BELIEVE 

WE KNOW THAT ERNEST EVERHARD WAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG MAN  BUT NOT SO
EXCEPTIONAL AS HIS WIFE THOUGHT HIM TO BE  HE WAS  AFTER ALL  BUT ONE OF
A LARGE NUMBER OF HEROES WHO  THROUGHOUT THE WORLD  DEVOTED THEIR LIVES
TO THE REVOLUTION THOUGH IT MUST BE CONCEDED THAT HE DID UNUSUAL
WORK  ESPECIALLY IN HIS ELABORATION AND INTERPRETATION OF WORKINGCLASS
PHILOSOPHY  PROLETARIAN SCIENCE AND PROLETARIAN PHILOSOPHY WERE HIS
PHRASES FOR IT  AND THEREIN HE SHOWS THE PROVINCIALISM OF HIS MINDA
DEFECT  HOWEVER  THAT WAS DUE TO THE TIMES AND THAT NONE IN THAT DAY
COULD ESCAPE 

BUT TO RETURN TO THE MANUSCRIPT  ESPECIALLY VALUABLE IS IT IN
COMMUNICATING TO US THE FEEL OF THOSE TERRIBLE TIMES  NOWHERE DO WE FIND
MORE VIVIDLY PORTRAYED THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE PERSONS THAT LIVED IN
THAT TURBULENT PERIOD EMBRACED BETWEEN THE YEARS  AND THEIR
MISTAKES AND IGNORANCE  THEIR DOUBTS AND FEARS AND MISAPPREHENSIONS 
THEIR ETHICAL DELUSIONS  THEIR VIOLENT PASSIONS  THEIR INCONCEIVABLE
SORDIDNESS AND SELFISHNESS  THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE SO HARD FOR
US OF THIS ENLIGHTENED AGE TO UNDERSTAND  HISTORY TELLS US THAT THESE
THINGS WERE  AND BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY TELL US WHY THEY WERE BUT
HISTORY AND BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY DO NOT MAKE THESE THINGS ALIVE  WE
ACCEPT THEM AS FACTS  BUT WE ARE LEFT WITHOUT SYMPATHETIC COMPREHENSION
OF THEM 

THIS SYMPATHY COMES TO US  HOWEVER  AS WE PERUSE THE EVERHARD
MANUSCRIPT  WE ENTER INTO THE MINDS OF THE ACTORS IN THAT LONGAGO
WORLDDRAMA  AND FOR THE TIME BEING THEIR MENTAL PROCESSES ARE OUR
MENTAL PROCESSES  NOT ALONE DO WE UNDERSTAND AVIS EVERHARDS LOVE FOR
HER HEROHUSBAND  BUT WE FEEL  AS HE FELT  IN THOSE FIRST DAYS  THE
VAGUE AND TERRIBLE LOOM OF THE OLIGARCHY  THE IRON HEEL WELL NAMED WE
FEEL DESCENDING UPON AND CRUSHING MANKIND 

AND IN PASSING WE NOTE THAT THAT HISTORIC PHRASE  THE IRON HEEL 
ORIGINATED IN ERNEST EVERHARDS MIND  THIS  WE MAY SAY  IS THE ONE MOOT
QUESTION THAT THIS NEWFOUND DOCUMENT CLEARS UP  PREVIOUS TO THIS  THE
EARLIESTKNOWN USE OF THE PHRASE OCCURRED IN THE PAMPHLET  YE SLAVES 
WRITTEN BY GEORGE MILFORD AND PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER    THIS GEORGE
MILFORD WAS AN OBSCURE AGITATOR ABOUT WHOM NOTHING IS KNOWN  SAVE THE
ONE ADDITIONAL BIT OF INFORMATION GAINED FROM THE MANUSCRIPT  WHICH
MENTIONS THAT HE WAS SHOT IN THE CHICAGO COMMUNE  EVIDENTLY HE HAD
HEARD ERNEST EVERHARD MAKE USE OF THE PHRASE IN SOME PUBLIC SPEECH  MOST
PROBABLY WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN THE FALL OF   FROM THE
MANUSCRIPT WE LEARN THAT EVERHARD USED THE PHRASE AT A PRIVATE DINNER
IN THE SPRING OF   THIS IS  WITHOUT DISCUSSION  THE EARLIESTKNOWN
OCCASION ON WHICH THE OLIGARCHY WAS SO DESIGNATED 

THE RISE OF THE OLIGARCHY WILL ALWAYS REMAIN A CAUSE OF SECRET WONDER
TO THE HISTORIAN AND THE PHILOSOPHER  OTHER GREAT HISTORICAL EVENTS
HAVE THEIR PLACE IN SOCIAL EVOLUTION  THEY WERE INEVITABLE  THEIR COMING
COULD HAVE BEEN PREDICTED WITH THE SAME CERTITUDE THAT ASTRONOMERS
TODAY PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE MOVEMENTS OF STARS  WITHOUT THESE
OTHER GREAT HISTORICAL EVENTS  SOCIAL EVOLUTION COULD NOT HAVE
PROCEEDED  PRIMITIVE COMMUNISM  CHATTEL SLAVERY  SERF SLAVERY  AND WAGE
SLAVERY WERE NECESSARY STEPPINGSTONES IN THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIETY 
BUT IT WERE RIDICULOUS TO ASSERT THAT THE IRON HEEL WAS A NECESSARY
STEPPINGSTONE  RATHER  TODAY  IS IT ADJUDGED A STEP ASIDE  OR A STEP
BACKWARD  TO THE SOCIAL TYRANNIES THAT MADE THE EARLY WORLD A HELL  BUT
THAT WERE AS NECESSARY AS THE IRON HEEL WAS UNNECESSARY 

BLACK AS FEUDALISM WAS  YET THE COMING OF IT WAS INEVITABLE  WHAT ELSE
THAN FEUDALISM COULD HAVE FOLLOWED UPON THE BREAKDOWN OF THAT GREAT
CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENTAL MACHINE KNOWN AS THE ROMAN EMPIRE NOT
SO  HOWEVER  WITH THE IRON HEEL  IN THE ORDERLY PROCEDURE OF SOCIAL
EVOLUTION THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR IT  IT WAS NOT NECESSARY  AND IT WAS
NOT INEVITABLE  IT MUST ALWAYS REMAIN THE GREAT CURIOSITY OF HISTORYA
WHIM  A FANTASY  AN APPARITION  A THING UNEXPECTED AND UNDREAMED AND
IT SHOULD SERVE AS A WARNING TO THOSE RASH POLITICAL THEORISTS OF TODAY
WHO SPEAK WITH CERTITUDE OF SOCIAL PROCESSES 

CAPITALISM WAS ADJUDGED BY THE SOCIOLOGISTS OF THE TIME TO BE THE
CULMINATION OF BOURGEOIS RULE  THE RIPENED FRUIT OF THE BOURGEOIS
REVOLUTION  AND WE OF TODAY CAN BUT APPLAUD THAT JUDGMENT  FOLLOWING
UPON CAPITALISM  IT WAS HELD  EVEN BY SUCH INTELLECTUAL AND ANTAGONISTIC
GIANTS AS HERBERT SPENCER  THAT SOCIALISM WOULD COME  OUT OF THE DECAY
OF SELFSEEKING CAPITALISM  IT WAS HELD  WOULD ARISE THAT FLOWER OF THE
AGES  THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN  INSTEAD OF WHICH  APPALLING ALIKE TO
US WHO LOOK BACK AND TO THOSE THAT LIVED AT THE TIME  CAPITALISM 
ROTTENRIPE  SENT FORTH THAT MONSTROUS OFFSHOOT  THE OLIGARCHY 

TOO LATE DID THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT OF THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY
DIVINE THE COMING OF THE OLIGARCHY  EVEN AS IT WAS DIVINED  THE
OLIGARCHY WAS THEREA FACT ESTABLISHED IN BLOOD  A STUPENDOUS AND AWFUL
REALITY  NOR EVEN THEN  AS THE EVERHARD MANUSCRIPT WELL SHOWS  WAS ANY
PERMANENCE ATTRIBUTED TO THE IRON HEEL  ITS OVERTHROW WAS A MATTER OF
A FEW SHORT YEARS  WAS THE JUDGMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS  IT IS TRUE 
THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEASANT REVOLT WAS UNPLANNED  AND THAT THE FIRST
REVOLT WAS PREMATURE BUT THEY LITTLE REALIZED THAT THE SECOND REVOLT 
PLANNED AND MATURE  WAS DOOMED TO EQUAL FUTILITY AND MORE TERRIBLE
PUNISHMENT 

IT IS APPARENT THAT AVIS EVERHARD COMPLETED THE MANUSCRIPT DURING THE
LAST DAYS OF PREPARATION FOR THE SECOND REVOLT HENCE THE FACT THAT
THERE IS NO MENTION OF THE DISASTROUS OUTCOME OF THE SECOND REVOLT 
IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT SHE INTENDED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR IMMEDIATE
PUBLICATION  AS SOON AS THE IRON HEEL WAS OVERTHROWN  SO THAT HER
HUSBAND  SO RECENTLY DEAD  SHOULD RECEIVE FULL CREDIT FOR ALL THAT HE
HAD VENTURED AND ACCOMPLISHED  THEN CAME THE FRIGHTFUL CRUSHING OF THE
SECOND REVOLT  AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT IN THE MOMENT OF DANGER  ERE SHE
FLED OR WAS CAPTURED BY THE MERCENARIES  SHE HID THE MANUSCRIPT IN THE
HOLLOW OAK AT WAKE ROBIN LODGE 

OF AVIS EVERHARD THERE IS NO FURTHER RECORD  UNDOUBTEDLY SHE WAS
EXECUTED BY THE MERCENARIES AND  AS IS WELL KNOWN  NO RECORD OF SUCH
EXECUTIONS WAS KEPT BY THE IRON HEEL  BUT LITTLE DID SHE REALIZE  EVEN
THEN  AS SHE HID THE MANUSCRIPT AND PREPARED TO FLEE  HOW TERRIBLE HAD
BEEN THE BREAKDOWN OF THE SECOND REVOLT  LITTLE DID SHE REALIZE THAT
THE TORTUOUS AND DISTORTED EVOLUTION OF THE NEXT THREE CENTURIES WOULD
COMPEL A THIRD REVOLT AND A FOURTH REVOLT  AND MANY REVOLTS  ALL DROWNED
IN SEAS OF BLOOD  ERE THE WORLDMOVEMENT OF LABOR SHOULD COME INTO ITS
OWN  AND LITTLE DID SHE DREAM THAT FOR SEVEN LONG CENTURIES THE TRIBUTE
OF HER LOVE TO ERNEST EVERHARD WOULD REPOSE UNDISTURBED IN THE HEART OF
THE ANCIENT OAK OF WAKE ROBIN LODGE

THE IRON HEEL



CHAPTER I

MY EAGLE


THE SOFT SUMMER WIND STIRS THE REDWOODS  AND WILDWATER RIPPLES SWEET
CADENCES OVER ITS MOSSY STONES  THERE ARE BUTTERFLIES IN THE SUNSHINE 
AND FROM EVERYWHERE ARISES THE DROWSY HUM OF BEES  IT IS SO QUIET AND
PEACEFUL  AND I SIT HERE  AND PONDER  AND AM RESTLESS  IT IS THE QUIET
THAT MAKES ME RESTLESS  IT SEEMS UNREAL  ALL THE WORLD IS QUIET  BUT IT
IS THE QUIET BEFORE THE STORM  I STRAIN MY EARS  AND ALL MY SENSES  FOR
SOME BETRAYAL OF THAT IMPENDING STORM  OH  THAT IT MAY NOT BE PREMATURE
THAT IT MAY NOT BE PREMATURE

      THE SECOND REVOLT WAS LARGELY THE WORK OF ERNEST EVERHARD 
     THOUGH HE COOPERATED  OF COURSE  WITH THE EUROPEAN LEADERS 
     THE CAPTURE AND SECRET EXECUTION OF EVERHARD WAS THE GREAT
     EVENT OF THE SPRING OF  A D   YET SO THOROUGHLY HAD HE
     PREPARED FOR THE REVOLT  THAT HIS FELLOWCONSPIRATORS WERE
     ABLE  WITH LITTLE CONFUSION OR DELAY  TO CARRY OUT HIS
     PLANS   IT WAS AFTER EVERHARDS EXECUTION THAT HIS WIFE WENT
     TO WAKE ROBIN LODGE  A SMALL BUNGALOW IN THE SONOMA HILLS OF
     CALIFORNIA 

SMALL WONDER THAT I AM RESTLESS  I THINK  AND THINK  AND I CANNOT
CEASE FROM THINKING  I HAVE BEEN IN THE THICK OF LIFE SO LONG THAT I
AM OPPRESSED BY THE PEACE AND QUIET  AND I CANNOT FORBEAR FROM DWELLING
UPON THAT MAD MAELSTROM OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION SO SOON TO BURST FORTH 
IN MY EARS ARE THE CRIES OF THE STRICKEN AND I CAN SEE  AS I HAVE
SEEN IN THE PAST  ALL THE MARRING AND MANGLING OF THE SWEET  BEAUTIFUL
FLESH  AND THE SOULS TORN WITH VIOLENCE FROM PROUD BODIES AND HURLED TO
GOD  THUS DO WE POOR HUMANS ATTAIN OUR ENDS  STRIVING THROUGH CARNAGE
AND DESTRUCTION TO BRING LASTING PEACE AND HAPPINESS UPON THE EARTH 

      WITHOUT DOUBT SHE HERE REFERS TO THE CHICAGO COMMUNE 

AND THEN I AM LONELY  WHEN I DO NOT THINK OF WHAT IS TO COME  I THINK OF
WHAT HAS BEEN AND IS NO MOREMY EAGLE  BEATING WITH TIRELESS WINGS THE
VOID  SOARING TOWARD WHAT WAS EVER HIS SUN  THE FLAMING IDEAL OF HUMAN
FREEDOM  I CANNOT SIT IDLY BY AND WAIT THE GREAT EVENT THAT IS HIS
MAKING  THOUGH HE IS NOT HERE TO SEE  HE DEVOTED ALL THE YEARS OF HIS
MANHOOD TO IT  AND FOR IT HE GAVE HIS LIFE  IT IS HIS HANDIWORK  HE MADE
IT 

      WITH ALL RESPECT TO AVIS EVERHARD  IT MUST BE POINTED OUT
     THAT EVERHARD WAS BUT ONE OF MANY ABLE LEADERS WHO PLANNED
     THE SECOND REVOLT   AND WE TODAY  LOOKING BACK ACROSS THE
     CENTURIES  CAN SAFELY SAY THAT EVEN HAD HE LIVED  THE SECOND
     REVOLT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LESS CALAMITOUS IN ITS OUTCOME
     THAN IT WAS 

AND SO IT IS  IN THIS ANXIOUS TIME OF WAITING  THAT I SHALL WRITE OF
MY HUSBAND  THERE IS MUCH LIGHT THAT I ALONE OF ALL PERSONS LIVING CAN
THROW UPON HIS CHARACTER  AND SO NOBLE A CHARACTER CANNOT BE BLAZONED
FORTH TOO BRIGHTLY  HIS WAS A GREAT SOUL  AND  WHEN MY LOVE GROWS
UNSELFISH  MY CHIEFEST REGRET IS THAT HE IS NOT HERE TO WITNESS
TOMORROWS DAWN  WE CANNOT FAIL  HE HAS BUILT TOO STOUTLY AND TOO
SURELY FOR THAT  WOE TO THE IRON HEEL SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM
OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY  WHEN THE WORD GOES FORTH  THE LABOR HOSTS OF ALL
THE WORLD SHALL RISE  THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE HISTORY OF
THE WORLD  THE SOLIDARITY OF LABOR IS ASSURED  AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
WILL THERE BE AN INTERNATIONAL REVOLUTION WIDE AS THE WORLD IS WIDE 

      THE SECOND REVOLT WAS TRULY INTERNATIONAL   IT WAS A
     COLOSSAL PLANTOO COLOSSAL TO BE WROUGHT BY THE GENIUS OF
     ONE MAN ALONE  LABOR  IN ALL THE OLIGARCHIES OF THE WORLD 
     WAS PREPARED TO RISE AT THE SIGNAL   GERMANY  ITALY  FRANCE 
     AND ALL AUSTRALASIA WERE LABOR COUNTRIESSOCIALIST STATES 
     THEY WERE READY TO LEND AID TO THE REVOLUTION   GALLANTLY
     THEY DID AND IT WAS FOR THIS REASON  WHEN THE SECOND REVOLT
     WAS CRUSHED  THAT THEY  TOO  WERE CRUSHED BY THE UNITED
     OLIGARCHIES OF THE WORLD  THEIR SOCIALIST GOVERNMENTS BEING
     REPLACED BY OLIGARCHICAL GOVERNMENTS 

YOU SEE  I AM FULL OF WHAT IS IMPENDING  I HAVE LIVED IT DAY AND NIGHT
UTTERLY AND FOR SO LONG THAT IT IS EVER PRESENT IN MY MIND  FOR THAT
MATTER  I CANNOT THINK OF MY HUSBAND WITHOUT THINKING OF IT  HE WAS THE
SOUL OF IT  AND HOW CAN I POSSIBLY SEPARATE THE TWO IN THOUGHT

AS I HAVE SAID  THERE IS MUCH LIGHT THAT I ALONE CAN THROW UPON HIS
CHARACTER  IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT HE TOILED HARD FOR LIBERTY AND SUFFERED
SORE  HOW HARD HE TOILED AND HOW GREATLY HE SUFFERED  I WELL KNOW FOR
I HAVE BEEN WITH HIM DURING THESE TWENTY ANXIOUS YEARS AND I KNOW HIS
PATIENCE  HIS UNTIRING EFFORT  HIS INFINITE DEVOTION TO THE CAUSE FOR
WHICH  ONLY TWO MONTHS GONE  HE LAID DOWN HIS LIFE 

I SHALL TRY TO WRITE SIMPLY AND TO TELL HERE HOW ERNEST EVERHARD ENTERED
MY LIFEHOW I FIRST MET HIM  HOW HE GREW UNTIL I BECAME A PART OF HIM 
AND THE TREMENDOUS CHANGES HE WROUGHT IN MY LIFE  IN THIS WAY MAY YOU
LOOK AT HIM THROUGH MY EYES AND LEARN HIM AS I LEARNED HIMIN ALL SAVE
THE THINGS TOO SECRET AND SWEET FOR ME TO TELL 

IT WAS IN FEBRUARY    THAT I FIRST MET HIM  WHEN  AS A GUEST OF MY
FATHERS AT DINNER  HE CAME TO OUR HOUSE IN BERKELEY  I CANNOT SAY THAT
MY VERY FIRST IMPRESSION OF HIM WAS FAVORABLE  HE WAS ONE OF MANY AT
DINNER  AND IN THE DRAWINGROOM WHERE WE GATHERED AND WAITED FOR ALL
TO ARRIVE  HE MADE A RATHER INCONGRUOUS APPEARANCE  IT WAS PREACHERS
NIGHT  AS MY FATHER PRIVATELY CALLED IT  AND ERNEST WAS CERTAINLY OUT
OF PLACE IN THE MIDST OF THE CHURCHMEN 

      JOHN CUNNINGHAM  AVIS EVERHARDS FATHER  WAS A PROFESSOR
     AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY AT BERKELEY  CALIFORNIA   HIS CHOSEN
     FIELD WAS PHYSICS  AND IN ADDITION HE DID MUCH ORIGINAL
     RESEARCH AND WAS GREATLY DISTINGUISHED AS A SCIENTIST   HIS
     CHIEF CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENCE WAS HIS STUDIES OF THE
     ELECTRON AND HIS MONUMENTAL WORK ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF
     MATTER AND ENERGY  WHEREIN HE ESTABLISHED  BEYOND CAVIL AND
     FOR ALL TIME  THAT THE ULTIMATE UNIT OF MATTER AND THE
     ULTIMATE UNIT OF FORCE WERE IDENTICAL   THIS IDEA HAD BEEN
     EARLIER ADVANCED  BUT NOT DEMONSTRATED  BY SIR OLIVER LODGE
     AND OTHER STUDENTS IN THE NEW FIELD OF RADIOACTIVITY 

IN THE FIRST PLACE  HIS CLOTHES DID NOT FIT HIM  HE WORE A READYMADE
SUIT OF DARK CLOTH THAT WAS ILL ADJUSTED TO HIS BODY  IN FACT  NO
READYMADE SUIT OF CLOTHES EVER COULD FIT HIS BODY  AND ON THIS NIGHT 
AS ALWAYS  THE CLOTH BULGED WITH HIS MUSCLES  WHILE THE COAT BETWEEN
THE SHOULDERS  WHAT OF THE HEAVY SHOULDERDEVELOPMENT  WAS A MAZE OF
WRINKLES  HIS NECK WAS THE NECK OF A PRIZEFIGHTER  THICK AND STRONG 
SO THIS WAS THE SOCIAL PHILOSOPHER AND EXHORSESHOER MY FATHER HAD
DISCOVERED  WAS MY THOUGHT  AND HE CERTAINLY LOOKED IT WITH THOSE
BULGING MUSCLES AND THAT BULLTHROAT  IMMEDIATELY I CLASSIFIED HIMA
SORT OF PRODIGY  I THOUGHT  A BLIND TOM OF THE WORKING CLASS 

      IN THAT DAY IT WAS THE CUSTOM OF MEN TO COMPETE FOR PURSES
     OF MONEY   THEY FOUGHT WITH THEIR HANDS   WHEN ONE WAS
     BEATEN INTO INSENSIBILITY OR KILLED  THE SURVIVOR TOOK THE
     MONEY 

      THIS OBSCURE REFERENCE APPLIES TO A BLIND NEGRO MUSICIAN
     WHO TOOK THE WORLD BY STORM IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE
     NINETEENTH CENTURY OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA 

AND THEN  WHEN HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME HIS HANDSHAKE WAS FIRM AND
STRONG  BUT HE LOOKED AT ME BOLDLY WITH HIS BLACK EYESTOO BOLDLY  I
THOUGHT  YOU SEE  I WAS A CREATURE OF ENVIRONMENT  AND AT THAT TIME HAD
STRONG CLASS INSTINCTS  SUCH BOLDNESS ON THE PART OF A MAN OF MY OWN
CLASS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST UNFORGIVABLE  I KNOW THAT I COULD NOT AVOID
DROPPING MY EYES  AND I WAS QUITE RELIEVED WHEN I PASSED HIM ON AND
TURNED TO GREET BISHOP MOREHOUSEA FAVORITE OF MINE  A SWEET AND
SERIOUS MAN OF MIDDLE AGE  CHRISTLIKE IN APPEARANCE AND GOODNESS  AND A
SCHOLAR AS WELL 

BUT THIS BOLDNESS THAT I TOOK TO BE PRESUMPTION WAS A VITAL CLEW TO THE
NATURE OF ERNEST EVERHARD  HE WAS SIMPLE  DIRECT  AFRAID OF NOTHING  AND
HE REFUSED TO WASTE TIME ON CONVENTIONAL MANNERISMS  YOU PLEASED ME 
HE EXPLAINED LONG AFTERWARD AND WHY SHOULD I NOT FILL MY EYES WITH
THAT WHICH PLEASES ME I HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF NOTHING  HE
WAS A NATURAL ARISTOCRATAND THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS IN
THE CAMP OF THE NONARISTOCRATS  HE WAS A SUPERMAN  A BLOND BEAST
SUCH AS NIETZSCHE HAS DESCRIBED  AND IN ADDITION HE WAS AFLAME WITH
DEMOCRACY 

      FRIEDERICH NIETZSCHE  THE MAD PHILOSOPHER OF THE
     NINETEENTH CENTURY OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA  WHO CAUGHT WILD
     GLIMPSES OF TRUTH  BUT WHO  BEFORE HE WAS DONE  REASONED
     HIMSELF AROUND THE GREAT CIRCLE OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND OFF
     INTO MADNESS 

IN THE INTEREST OF MEETING THE OTHER GUESTS  AND WHAT OF MY UNFAVORABLE
IMPRESSION  I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE WORKINGCLASS PHILOSOPHER  THOUGH
ONCE OR TWICE AT TABLE I NOTICED HIMESPECIALLY THE TWINKLE IN HIS EYE
AS HE LISTENED TO THE TALK FIRST OF ONE MINISTER AND THEN OF ANOTHER  HE
HAS HUMOR  I THOUGHT  AND I ALMOST FORGAVE HIM HIS CLOTHES  BUT THE TIME
WENT BY  AND THE DINNER WENT BY  AND HE NEVER OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK 
WHILE THE MINISTERS TALKED INTERMINABLY ABOUT THE WORKING CLASS AND ITS
RELATION TO THE CHURCH  AND WHAT THE CHURCH HAD DONE AND WAS DOING FOR
IT  I NOTICED THAT MY FATHER WAS ANNOYED BECAUSE ERNEST DID NOT TALK 
ONCE FATHER TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A LULL AND ASKED HIM TO SAY SOMETHING BUT
ERNEST SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WITH AN I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY WENT
ON EATING SALTED ALMONDS 

BUT FATHER WAS NOT TO BE DENIED  AFTER A WHILE HE SAID 

WE HAVE WITH US A MEMBER OF THE WORKING CLASS  I AM SURE THAT HE CAN
PRESENT THINGS FROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW THAT WILL BE INTERESTING AND
REFRESHING  I REFER TO MR  EVERHARD 

THE OTHERS BETRAYED A WELLMANNERED INTEREST  AND URGED ERNEST FOR
A STATEMENT OF HIS VIEWS  THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD HIM WAS SO BROADLY
TOLERANT AND KINDLY THAT IT WAS REALLY PATRONIZING  AND I SAW THAT
ERNEST NOTED IT AND WAS AMUSED  HE LOOKED SLOWLY ABOUT HIM  AND I SAW
THE GLINT OF LAUGHTER IN HIS EYES 

I AM NOT VERSED IN THE COURTESIES OF ECCLESIASTICAL CONTROVERSY  HE
BEGAN  AND THEN HESITATED WITH MODESTY AND INDECISION 

GO ON  THEY URGED  AND DR  HAMMERFIELD SAID  WE DO NOT MIND THE TRUTH
THAT IS IN ANY MAN  IF IT IS SINCERE  HE AMENDED 

THEN YOU SEPARATE SINCERITY FROM TRUTH ERNEST LAUGHED QUICKLY 

DR  HAMMERFIELD GASPED  AND MANAGED TO ANSWER  THE BEST OF US MAY BE
MISTAKEN  YOUNG MAN  THE BEST OF US 

ERNESTS MANNER CHANGED ON THE INSTANT  HE BECAME ANOTHER MAN 

ALL RIGHT  THEN  HE ANSWERED AND LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT YOU
ARE ALL MISTAKEN  YOU KNOW NOTHING  AND WORSE THAN NOTHING  ABOUT THE
WORKING CLASS  YOUR SOCIOLOGY IS AS VICIOUS AND WORTHLESS AS IS YOUR
METHOD OF THINKING 

IT WAS NOT SO MUCH WHAT HE SAID AS HOW HE SAID IT  I ROUSED AT THE FIRST
SOUND OF HIS VOICE  IT WAS AS BOLD AS HIS EYES  IT WAS A CLARIONCALL
THAT THRILLED ME  AND THE WHOLE TABLE WAS AROUSED  SHAKEN ALIVE FROM
MONOTONY AND DROWSINESS 

WHAT IS SO DREADFULLY VICIOUS AND WORTHLESS IN OUR METHOD OF THINKING 
YOUNG MAN DR  HAMMERFIELD DEMANDED  AND ALREADY THERE WAS SOMETHING
UNPLEASANT IN HIS VOICE AND MANNER OF UTTERANCE 

YOU ARE METAPHYSICIANS  YOU CAN PROVE ANYTHING BY METAPHYSICS AND
HAVING DONE SO  EVERY METAPHYSICIAN CAN PROVE EVERY OTHER METAPHYSICIAN
WRONGTO HIS OWN SATISFACTION  YOU ARE ANARCHISTS IN THE REALM OF
THOUGHT  AND YOU ARE MAD COSMOSMAKERS  EACH OF YOU DWELLS IN A COSMOS
OF HIS OWN MAKING  CREATED OUT OF HIS OWN FANCIES AND DESIRES  YOU DO
NOT KNOW THE REAL WORLD IN WHICH YOU LIVE  AND YOUR THINKING HAS NO
PLACE IN THE REAL WORLD EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS IT IS PHENOMENA OF MENTAL
ABERRATION 

DO YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS REMINDED OF AS I SAT AT TABLE AND LISTENED TO
YOU TALK AND TALK YOU REMINDED ME FOR ALL THE WORLD OF THE SCHOLASTICS
OF THE MIDDLE AGES WHO GRAVELY AND LEARNEDLY DEBATED THE ABSORBING
QUESTION OF HOW MANY ANGELS COULD DANCE ON THE POINT OF A NEEDLE 
WHY  MY DEAR SIRS  YOU ARE AS REMOTE FROM THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THE
TWENTIETH CENTURY AS AN INDIAN MEDICINEMAN MAKING INCANTATION IN THE
PRIMEVAL FOREST TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO 

AS ERNEST TALKED HE SEEMED IN A FINE PASSION HIS FACE GLOWED  HIS
EYES SNAPPED AND FLASHED  AND HIS CHIN AND JAW WERE ELOQUENT WITH
AGGRESSIVENESS  BUT IT WAS ONLY A WAY HE HAD  IT ALWAYS AROUSED PEOPLE 
HIS SMASHING  SLEDGEHAMMER MANNER OF ATTACK INVARIABLY MADE THEM FORGET
THEMSELVES  AND THEY WERE FORGETTING THEMSELVES NOW  BISHOP MOREHOUSE
WAS LEANING FORWARD AND LISTENING INTENTLY  EXASPERATION AND ANGER WERE
FLUSHING THE FACE OF DR  HAMMERFIELD  AND OTHERS WERE EXASPERATED  TOO 
AND SOME WERE SMILING IN AN AMUSED AND SUPERIOR WAY  AS FOR MYSELF  I
FOUND IT MOST ENJOYABLE  I GLANCED AT FATHER  AND I WAS AFRAID HE WAS
GOING TO GIGGLE AT THE EFFECT OF THIS HUMAN BOMBSHELL HE HAD BEEN GUILTY
OF LAUNCHING AMONGST US 

YOUR TERMS ARE RATHER VAGUE  DR  HAMMERFIELD INTERRUPTED  JUST
PRECISELY WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU CALL US METAPHYSICIANS

I CALL YOU METAPHYSICIANS BECAUSE YOU REASON METAPHYSICALLY  ERNEST
WENT ON  YOUR METHOD OF REASONING IS THE OPPOSITE TO THAT OF SCIENCE 
THERE IS NO VALIDITY TO YOUR CONCLUSIONS  YOU CAN PROVE EVERYTHING AND
NOTHING  AND NO TWO OF YOU CAN AGREE UPON ANYTHING  EACH OF YOU GOES
INTO HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND THE UNIVERSE  AS
WELL MAY YOU LIFT YOURSELVES BY YOUR OWN BOOTSTRAPS AS TO EXPLAIN
CONSCIOUSNESS BY CONSCIOUSNESS 

I DO NOT UNDERSTAND  BISHOP MOREHOUSE SAID  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL
THINGS OF THE MIND ARE METAPHYSICAL  THAT MOST EXACT AND CONVINCING
OF ALL SCIENCES  MATHEMATICS  IS SHEERLY METAPHYSICAL  EACH AND EVERY
THOUGHTPROCESS OF THE SCIENTIFIC REASONER IS METAPHYSICAL  SURELY YOU
WILL AGREE WITH ME

AS YOU SAY  YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND  ERNEST REPLIED  THE METAPHYSICIAN
REASONS DEDUCTIVELY OUT OF HIS OWN SUBJECTIVITY  THE SCIENTIST REASONS
INDUCTIVELY FROM THE FACTS OF EXPERIENCE  THE METAPHYSICIAN REASONS
FROM THEORY TO FACTS  THE SCIENTIST REASONS FROM FACTS TO THEORY  THE
METAPHYSICIAN EXPLAINS THE UNIVERSE BY HIMSELF  THE SCIENTIST EXPLAINS
HIMSELF BY THE UNIVERSE 

THANK GOD WE ARE NOT SCIENTISTS  DR  HAMMERFIELD MURMURED
COMPLACENTLY 

WHAT ARE YOU THEN ERNEST DEMANDED 

PHILOSOPHERS 

THERE YOU GO  ERNEST LAUGHED  YOU HAVE LEFT THE REAL AND SOLID EARTH
AND ARE UP IN THE AIR WITH A WORD FOR A FLYING MACHINE  PRAY COME DOWN
TO EARTH AND TELL ME PRECISELY WHAT YOU DO MEAN BY PHILOSOPHY 

PHILOSOPHY IS DR  HAMMERFIELD PAUSED AND CLEARED HIS
THROATSOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE DEFINED COMPREHENSIVELY EXCEPT TO
SUCH MINDS AND TEMPERAMENTS AS ARE PHILOSOPHICAL  THE NARROW SCIENTIST
WITH HIS NOSE IN A TESTTUBE CANNOT UNDERSTAND PHILOSOPHY 

ERNEST IGNORED THE THRUST  IT WAS ALWAYS HIS WAY TO TURN THE POINT BACK
UPON AN OPPONENT  AND HE DID IT NOW  WITH A BEAMING BROTHERLINESS OF
FACE AND UTTERANCE 

THEN YOU WILL UNDOUBTEDLY UNDERSTAND THE DEFINITION I SHALL NOW MAKE
OF PHILOSOPHY  BUT BEFORE I MAKE IT  I SHALL CHALLENGE YOU TO POINT OUT
ERROR IN IT OR TO REMAIN A SILENT METAPHYSICIAN  PHILOSOPHY IS MERELY
THE WIDEST SCIENCE OF ALL  ITS REASONING METHOD IS THE SAME AS THAT OF
ANY PARTICULAR SCIENCE AND OF ALL PARTICULAR SCIENCES  AND BY THAT
SAME METHOD OF REASONING  THE INDUCTIVE METHOD  PHILOSOPHY FUSES ALL
PARTICULAR SCIENCES INTO ONE GREAT SCIENCE  AS SPENCER SAYS  THE DATA
OF ANY PARTICULAR SCIENCE ARE PARTIALLY UNIFIED KNOWLEDGE  PHILOSOPHY
UNIFIES THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IS CONTRIBUTED BY ALL THE SCIENCES 
PHILOSOPHY IS THE SCIENCE OF SCIENCE  THE MASTER SCIENCE  IF YOU PLEASE 
HOW DO YOU LIKE MY DEFINITION

VERY CREDITABLE  VERY CREDITABLE  DR  HAMMERFIELD MUTTERED LAMELY 

BUT ERNEST WAS MERCILESS 

REMEMBER  HE WARNED  MY DEFINITION IS FATAL TO METAPHYSICS  IF YOU DO
NOT NOW POINT OUT A FLAW IN MY DEFINITION  YOU ARE DISQUALIFIED LATER ON
FROM ADVANCING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS  YOU MUST GO THROUGH LIFE SEEKING
THAT FLAW AND REMAINING METAPHYSICALLY SILENT UNTIL YOU HAVE FOUND IT 

ERNEST WAITED  THE SILENCE WAS PAINFUL  DR  HAMMERFIELD WAS PAINED  HE
WAS ALSO PUZZLED  ERNESTS SLEDGEHAMMER ATTACK DISCONCERTED HIM  HE
WAS NOT USED TO THE SIMPLE AND DIRECT METHOD OF CONTROVERSY  HE LOOKED
APPEALINGLY AROUND THE TABLE  BUT NO ONE ANSWERED FOR HIM  I CAUGHT
FATHER GRINNING INTO HIS NAPKIN 

THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OF DISQUALIFYING THE METAPHYSICIANS  ERNEST SAID 
WHEN HE HAD RENDERED DR  HAMMERFIELDS DISCOMFITURE COMPLETE  JUDGE
THEM BY THEIR WORKS  WHAT HAVE THEY DONE FOR MANKIND BEYOND THE SPINNING
OF AIRY FANCIES AND THE MISTAKING OF THEIR OWN SHADOWS FOR GODS THEY
HAVE ADDED TO THE GAYETY OF MANKIND  I GRANT BUT WHAT TANGIBLE GOOD
HAVE THEY WROUGHT FOR MANKIND THEY PHILOSOPHIZED  IF YOU WILL PARDON MY
MISUSE OF THE WORD  ABOUT THE HEART AS THE SEAT OF THE EMOTIONS  WHILE
THE SCIENTISTS WERE FORMULATING THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD  THEY
DECLAIMED ABOUT FAMINE AND PESTILENCE AS BEING SCOURGES OF GOD  WHILE
THE SCIENTISTS WERE BUILDING GRANARIES AND DRAINING CITIES  THEY
BUILDED GODS IN THEIR OWN SHAPES AND OUT OF THEIR OWN DESIRES  WHILE
THE SCIENTISTS WERE BUILDING ROADS AND BRIDGES  THEY WERE DESCRIBING
THE EARTH AS THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE  WHILE THE SCIENTISTS WERE
DISCOVERING AMERICA AND PROBING SPACE FOR THE STARS AND THE LAWS OF
THE STARS  IN SHORT  THE METAPHYSICIANS HAVE DONE NOTHING  ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING  FOR MANKIND  STEP BY STEP  BEFORE THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE  THEY
HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BACK  AS FAST AS THE ASCERTAINED FACTS OF SCIENCE HAVE
OVERTHROWN THEIR SUBJECTIVE EXPLANATIONS OF THINGS  THEY HAVE MADE NEW
SUBJECTIVE EXPLANATIONS OF THINGS  INCLUDING EXPLANATIONS OF THE LATEST
ASCERTAINED FACTS  AND THIS  I DOUBT NOT  THEY WILL GO ON DOING TO
THE END OF TIME  GENTLEMEN  A METAPHYSICIAN IS A MEDICINE MAN 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE ESKIMO WHO MAKES A FURCLAD
BLUBBEREATING GOD IS MERELY A DIFFERENCE OF SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS OF
ASCERTAINED FACTS  THAT IS ALL 

YET THE THOUGHT OF ARISTOTLE RULED EUROPE FOR TWELVE CENTURIES  DR 
BALLINGFORD ANNOUNCED POMPOUSLY  AND ARISTOTLE WAS A METAPHYSICIAN 

DR  BALLINGFORD GLANCED AROUND THE TABLE AND WAS REWARDED BY NODS AND
SMILES OF APPROVAL 

YOUR ILLUSTRATION IS MOST UNFORTUNATE  ERNEST REPLIED  YOU REFER TO A
VERY DARK PERIOD IN HUMAN HISTORY  IN FACT  WE CALL THAT PERIOD THE DARK
AGES  A PERIOD WHEREIN SCIENCE WAS RAPED BY THE METAPHYSICIANS  WHEREIN
PHYSICS BECAME A SEARCH FOR THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE  WHEREIN CHEMISTRY
BECAME ALCHEMY  AND ASTRONOMY BECAME ASTROLOGY  SORRY THE DOMINATION OF
ARISTOTLES THOUGHT

DR  BALLINGFORD LOOKED PAINED  THEN HE BRIGHTENED UP AND SAID 

GRANTED THIS HORRIBLE PICTURE YOU HAVE DRAWN  YET YOU MUST CONFESS THAT
METAPHYSICS WAS INHERENTLY POTENT IN SO FAR AS IT DREW HUMANITY OUT
OF THIS DARK PERIOD AND ON INTO THE ILLUMINATION OF THE SUCCEEDING
CENTURIES 

METAPHYSICS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT  ERNEST RETORTED 

WHAT DR  HAMMERFIELD CRIED  IT WAS NOT THE THINKING AND THE
SPECULATION THAT LED TO THE VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY

AH  MY DEAR SIR  ERNEST SMILED  I THOUGHT YOU WERE DISQUALIFIED  YOU
HAVE NOT YET PICKED OUT THE FLAW IN MY DEFINITION OF PHILOSOPHY  YOU ARE
NOW ON AN UNSUBSTANTIAL BASIS  BUT IT IS THE WAY OF THE METAPHYSICIANS 
AND I FORGIVE YOU  NO  I REPEAT  METAPHYSICS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
IT  BREAD AND BUTTER  SILKS AND JEWELS  DOLLARS AND CENTS  AND 
INCIDENTALLY  THE CLOSING UP OF THE OVERLAND TRADEROUTES TO INDIA 
WERE THE THINGS THAT CAUSED THE VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY  WITH THE FALL OF
CONSTANTINOPLE  IN   THE TURKS BLOCKED THE WAY OF THE CARAVANS TO
INDIA  THE TRADERS OF EUROPE HAD TO FIND ANOTHER ROUTE  HERE WAS THE
ORIGINAL CAUSE FOR THE VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY  COLUMBUS SAILED TO FIND
A NEW ROUTE TO THE INDIES  IT IS SO STATED IN ALL THE HISTORY BOOKS 
INCIDENTALLY  NEW FACTS WERE LEARNED ABOUT THE NATURE  SIZE  AND FORM OF
THE EARTH  AND THE PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM WENT GLIMMERING 

DR  HAMMERFIELD SNORTED 

YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ME ERNEST QUERIED  THEN WHEREIN AM I WRONG

I CAN ONLY REAFFIRM MY POSITION  DR  HAMMERFIELD RETORTED TARTLY  IT
IS TOO LONG A STORY TO ENTER INTO NOW 

NO STORY IS TOO LONG FOR THE SCIENTIST  ERNEST SAID SWEETLY  THAT IS
WHY THE SCIENTIST GETS TO PLACES  THAT IS WHY HE GOT TO AMERICA 

I SHALL NOT DESCRIBE THE WHOLE EVENING  THOUGH IT IS A JOY TO ME TO
RECALL EVERY MOMENT  EVERY DETAIL  OF THOSE FIRST HOURS OF MY COMING TO
KNOW ERNEST EVERHARD 

BATTLE ROYAL RAGED  AND THE MINISTERS GREW REDFACED AND EXCITED 
ESPECIALLY AT THE MOMENTS WHEN ERNEST CALLED THEM ROMANTIC PHILOSOPHERS 
SHADOWPROJECTORS  AND SIMILAR THINGS  AND ALWAYS HE CHECKED THEM BACK
TO FACTS  THE FACT  MAN  THE IRREFRAGABLE FACT HE WOULD PROCLAIM
TRIUMPHANTLY  WHEN HE HAD BROUGHT ONE OF THEM A CROPPER  HE BRISTLED
WITH FACTS  HE TRIPPED THEM UP WITH FACTS  AMBUSCADED THEM WITH FACTS 
BOMBARDED THEM WITH BROADSIDES OF FACTS 

YOU SEEM TO WORSHIP AT THE SHRINE OF FACT  DR  HAMMERFIELD TAUNTED
HIM 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT FACT  AND MR  EVERHARD IS ITS PROPHET  DR 
BALLINGFORD PARAPHRASED 

ERNEST SMILINGLY ACQUIESCED 

IM LIKE THE MAN FROM TEXAS  HE SAID  AND  ON BEING SOLICITED  HE
EXPLAINED  YOU SEE  THE MAN FROM MISSOURI ALWAYS SAYS  YOUVE GOT
TO SHOW ME  BUT THE MAN FROM TEXAS SAYS  YOUVE GOT TO PUT IT IN MY
HAND  FROM WHICH IT IS APPARENT THAT HE IS NO METAPHYSICIAN 

ANOTHER TIME  WHEN ERNEST HAD JUST SAID THAT THE METAPHYSICAL
PHILOSOPHERS COULD NEVER STAND THE TEST OF TRUTH  DR  HAMMERFIELD
SUDDENLY DEMANDED 

WHAT IS THE TEST OF TRUTH  YOUNG MAN WILL YOU KINDLY EXPLAIN WHAT HAS
SO LONG PUZZLED WISER HEADS THAN YOURS

CERTAINLY  ERNEST ANSWERED  HIS COCKSURENESS IRRITATED THEM  THE WISE
HEADS HAVE PUZZLED SO SORELY OVER TRUTH BECAUSE THEY WENT UP INTO THE
AIR AFTER IT  HAD THEY REMAINED ON THE SOLID EARTH  THEY WOULD HAVE
FOUND IT EASILY ENOUGHAY  THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT THEY THEMSELVES
WERE PRECISELY TESTING TRUTH WITH EVERY PRACTICAL ACT AND THOUGHT OF
THEIR LIVES 

THE TEST  THE TEST  DR  HAMMERFIELD REPEATED IMPATIENTLY  NEVER MIND
THE PREAMBLE  GIVE US THAT WHICH WE HAVE SOUGHT SO LONGTHE TEST OF
TRUTH  GIVE IT US  AND WE WILL BE AS GODS 

THERE WAS AN IMPOLITE AND SNEERING SCEPTICISM IN HIS WORDS AND MANNER
THAT SECRETLY PLEASED MOST OF THEM AT THE TABLE  THOUGH IT SEEMED TO
BOTHER BISHOP MOREHOUSE 

DR  JORDAN HAS STATED IT VERY CLEARLY  ERNEST SAID  HIS TEST OF
TRUTH IS  WILL IT WORK WILL YOU TRUST YOUR LIFE TO IT

      A NOTED EDUCATOR OF THE LATE NINETEENTH AND EARLY
     TWENTIETH CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA   HE WAS PRESIDENT
     OF THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY  A PRIVATE BENEFACTION OF THE
     TIMES 

PISH DR  HAMMERFIELD SNEERED  YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN BISHOP BERKELEY
INTO ACCOUNT  HE HAS NEVER BEEN ANSWERED 

      AN IDEALISTIC MONIST WHO LONG PUZZLED THE PHILOSOPHERS OF
     THAT TIME WITH HIS DENIAL OF THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER  BUT
     WHOSE CLEVER ARGUMENT WAS FINALLY DEMOLISHED WHEN THE NEW
     EMPIRIC FACTS OF SCIENCE WERE PHILOSOPHICALLY GENERALIZED 

THE NOBLEST METAPHYSICIAN OF THEM ALL  ERNEST LAUGHED  BUT YOUR
EXAMPLE IS UNFORTUNATE  AS BERKELEY HIMSELF ATTESTED  HIS METAPHYSICS
DIDNT WORK 

DR  HAMMERFIELD WAS ANGRY  RIGHTEOUSLY ANGRY  IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD
CAUGHT ERNEST IN A THEFT OR A LIE 

YOUNG MAN  HE TRUMPETED  THAT STATEMENT IS ON A PAR WITH ALL YOU HAVE
UTTERED TONIGHT  IT IS A BASE AND UNWARRANTED ASSUMPTION 

I AM QUITE CRUSHED  ERNEST MURMURED MEEKLY  ONLY I DONT KNOW WHAT
HIT ME  YOULL HAVE TO PUT IT IN MY HAND  DOCTOR 

I WILL  I WILL  DR  HAMMERFIELD SPLUTTERED  HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU
DO NOT KNOW THAT BISHOP BERKELEY ATTESTED THAT HIS METAPHYSICS DID NOT
WORK  YOU HAVE NO PROOF  YOUNG MAN  THEY HAVE ALWAYS WORKED 

I TAKE IT AS PROOF THAT BERKELEYS METAPHYSICS DID NOT WORK  BECAUSE
ERNEST PAUSED CALMLY FOR A MOMENT  BECAUSE BERKELEY MADE AN INVARIABLE
PRACTICE OF GOING THROUGH DOORS INSTEAD OF WALLS  BECAUSE HE TRUSTED HIS
LIFE TO SOLID BREAD AND BUTTER AND ROAST BEEF  BECAUSE HE SHAVED HIMSELF
WITH A RAZOR THAT WORKED WHEN IT REMOVED THE HAIR FROM HIS FACE 

BUT THOSE ARE ACTUAL THINGS DR  HAMMERFIELD CRIED  METAPHYSICS IS OF
THE MIND 

AND THEY WORKIN THE MIND ERNEST QUERIED SOFTLY 

THE OTHER NODDED 

AND EVEN A MULTITUDE OF ANGELS CAN DANCE ON THE POINT OF A NEEDLEIN
THE MIND  ERNEST WENT ON REFLECTIVELY  AND A BLUBBEREATING  FURCLAD
GOD CAN EXIST AND WORKIN THE MIND AND THERE ARE NO PROOFS TO THE
CONTRARYIN THE MIND  I SUPPOSE  DOCTOR  YOU LIVE IN THE MIND

MY MIND TO ME A KINGDOM IS  WAS THE ANSWER 

THATS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT YOU LIVE UP IN THE AIR  BUT YOU COME
BACK TO EARTH AT MEALTIME  I AM SURE  OR WHEN AN EARTHQUAKE HAPPENS
ALONG  OR  TELL ME  DOCTOR  DO YOU HAVE NO APPREHENSION IN AN EARTHQUAKE
THAT THAT INCORPOREAL BODY OF YOURS WILL BE HIT BY AN IMMATERIAL BRICK

INSTANTLY  AND QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY  DR  HAMMERFIELDS HAND SHOT UP TO
HIS HEAD  WHERE A SCAR DISAPPEARED UNDER THE HAIR  IT HAPPENED THAT
ERNEST HAD BLUNDERED ON AN APPOSITE ILLUSTRATION  DR  HAMMERFIELD
HAD BEEN NEARLY KILLED IN THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE BY A FALLING CHIMNEY 
EVERYBODY BROKE OUT INTO ROARS OF LAUGHTER 

      THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE OF  A D  THAT DESTROYED SAN
     FRANCISCO 

WELL ERNEST ASKED  WHEN THE MERRIMENT HAD SUBSIDED  PROOFS TO THE
CONTRARY

AND IN THE SILENCE HE ASKED AGAIN  WELL THEN HE ADDED  STILL WELL 
BUT NOT SO WELL  THAT ARGUMENT OF YOURS 

BUT DR  HAMMERFIELD WAS TEMPORARILY CRUSHED  AND THE BATTLE RAGED ON IN
NEW DIRECTIONS  ON POINT AFTER POINT  ERNEST CHALLENGED THE MINISTERS 
WHEN THEY AFFIRMED THAT THEY KNEW THE WORKING CLASS  HE TOLD THEM
FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS ABOUT THE WORKING CLASS THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW  AND
CHALLENGED THEM FOR DISPROOFS  HE GAVE THEM FACTS  ALWAYS FACTS  CHECKED
THEIR EXCURSIONS INTO THE AIR  AND BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE SOLID EARTH
AND ITS FACTS 

HOW THE SCENE COMES BACK TO ME I CAN HEAR HIM NOW  WITH THAT WARNOTE
IN HIS VOICE  FLAYING THEM WITH HIS FACTS  EACH FACT A LASH THAT STUNG
AND STUNG AGAIN  AND HE WAS MERCILESS  HE TOOK NO QUARTER  AND GAVE
NONE  I CAN NEVER FORGET THE FLAYING HE GAVE THEM AT THE END 

      THIS FIGURE ARISES FROM THE CUSTOMS OF THE TIMES   WHEN 
     AMONG MEN FIGHTING TO THE DEATH IN THEIR WILDANIMAL WAY  A
     BEATEN MAN THREW DOWN HIS WEAPONS  IT WAS AT THE OPTION OF
     THE VICTOR TO SLAY HIM OR SPARE HIM 

YOU HAVE REPEATEDLY CONFESSED TONIGHT  BY DIRECT AVOWAL OR IGNORANT
STATEMENT  THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW THE WORKING CLASS  BUT YOU ARE NOT TO BE
BLAMED FOR THIS  HOW CAN YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE WORKING CLASS YOU
DO NOT LIVE IN THE SAME LOCALITY WITH THE WORKING CLASS  YOU HERD
WITH THE CAPITALIST CLASS IN ANOTHER LOCALITY  AND WHY NOT IT IS THE
CAPITALIST CLASS THAT PAYS YOU  THAT FEEDS YOU  THAT PUTS THE VERY
CLOTHES ON YOUR BACKS THAT YOU ARE WEARING TONIGHT  AND IN RETURN YOU
PREACH TO YOUR EMPLOYERS THE BRANDS OF METAPHYSICS THAT ARE ESPECIALLY
ACCEPTABLE TO THEM AND THE ESPECIALLY ACCEPTABLE BRANDS ARE ACCEPTABLE
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MENACE THE ESTABLISHED ORDER OF SOCIETY 

HERE THERE WAS A STIR OF DISSENT AROUND THE TABLE 

OH  I AM NOT CHALLENGING YOUR SINCERITY  ERNEST CONTINUED  YOU ARE
SINCERE  YOU PREACH WHAT YOU BELIEVE  THERE LIES YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR
VALUETO THE CAPITALIST CLASS  BUT SHOULD YOU CHANGE YOUR BELIEF TO
SOMETHING THAT MENACES THE ESTABLISHED ORDER  YOUR PREACHING WOULD
BE UNACCEPTABLE TO YOUR EMPLOYERS  AND YOU WOULD BE DISCHARGED  EVERY
LITTLE WHILE SOME ONE OR ANOTHER OF YOU IS SO DISCHARGED  AM I NOT
RIGHT

      DURING THIS PERIOD THERE WERE MANY MINISTERS CAST OUT OF
     THE CHURCH FOR PREACHING UNACCEPTABLE DOCTRINE   ESPECIALLY
     WERE THEY CAST OUT WHEN THEIR PREACHING BECAME TAINTED WITH
     SOCIALISM 

THIS TIME THERE WAS NO DISSENT  THEY SAT DUMBLY ACQUIESCENT  WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF DR  HAMMERFIELD  WHO SAID 

IT IS WHEN THEIR THINKING IS WRONG THAT THEY ARE ASKED TO RESIGN 

WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING WHEN THEIR THINKING IS UNACCEPTABLE 
ERNEST ANSWERED  AND THEN WENT ON  SO I SAY TO YOU  GO AHEAD AND PREACH
AND EARN YOUR PAY  BUT FOR GOODNESS SAKE LEAVE THE WORKING CLASS ALONE 
YOU BELONG IN THE ENEMYS CAMP  YOU HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE
WORKING CLASS  YOUR HANDS ARE SOFT WITH THE WORK OTHERS HAVE PERFORMED
FOR YOU  YOUR STOMACHS ARE ROUND WITH THE PLENITUDE OF EATING  HERE
DR  BALLINGFORD WINCED  AND EVERY EYE GLANCED AT HIS PRODIGIOUS GIRTH 
IT WAS SAID HE HAD NOT SEEN HIS OWN FEET IN YEARS  AND YOUR MINDS ARE
FILLED WITH DOCTRINES THAT ARE BUTTRESSES OF THE ESTABLISHED ORDER  YOU
ARE AS MUCH MERCENARIES SINCERE MERCENARIES  I GRANT AS WERE THE MEN
OF THE SWISS GUARD  BE TRUE TO YOUR SALT AND YOUR HIRE GUARD  WITH
YOUR PREACHING  THE INTERESTS OF YOUR EMPLOYERS BUT DO NOT COME DOWN TO
THE WORKING CLASS AND SERVE AS FALSE LEADERS  YOU CANNOT HONESTLY BE IN
THE TWO CAMPS AT ONCE  THE WORKING CLASS HAS DONE WITHOUT YOU  BELIEVE
ME  THE WORKING CLASS WILL CONTINUE TO DO WITHOUT YOU  AND  FURTHERMORE 
THE WORKING CLASS CAN DO BETTER WITHOUT YOU THAN WITH YOU 

      THE HIRED FOREIGN PALACE GUARDS OF LOUIS XVI  A KING OF
     FRANCE THAT WAS BEHEADED BY HIS PEOPLE 



CHAPTER II

CHALLENGES 


AFTER THE GUESTS HAD GONE  FATHER THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR AND GAVE
VENT TO ROARS OF GARGANTUAN LAUGHTER  NOT SINCE THE DEATH OF MY MOTHER
HAD I KNOWN HIM TO LAUGH SO HEARTILY 

ILL WAGER DR  HAMMERFIELD WAS NEVER UP AGAINST ANYTHING LIKE IT IN HIS
LIFE  HE LAUGHED  THE COURTESIES OF ECCLESIASTICAL CONTROVERSY DID
YOU NOTICE HOW HE BEGAN LIKE A LAMBEVERHARD  I MEAN  AND HOW QUICKLY
HE BECAME A ROARING LION HE HAS A SPLENDIDLY DISCIPLINED MIND  HE WOULD
HAVE MADE A GOOD SCIENTIST IF HIS ENERGIES HAD BEEN DIRECTED THAT WAY 

I NEED SCARCELY SAY THAT I WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN ERNEST EVERHARD  IT
WAS NOT ALONE WHAT HE HAD SAID AND HOW HE HAD SAID IT  BUT IT WAS THE
MAN HIMSELF  I HAD NEVER MET A MAN LIKE HIM  I SUPPOSE THAT WAS WHY  IN
SPITE OF MY TWENTYFOUR YEARS  I HAD NOT MARRIED  I LIKED HIM I HAD TO
CONFESS IT TO MYSELF  AND MY LIKE FOR HIM WAS FOUNDED ON THINGS
BEYOND INTELLECT AND ARGUMENT  REGARDLESS OF HIS BULGING MUSCLES AND
PRIZEFIGHTERS THROAT  HE IMPRESSED ME AS AN INGENUOUS BOY  I FELT
THAT UNDER THE GUISE OF AN INTELLECTUAL SWASHBUCKLER WAS A DELICATE AND
SENSITIVE SPIRIT  I SENSED THIS  IN WAYS I KNEW NOT  SAVE THAT THEY WERE
MY WOMANS INTUITIONS 

THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THAT CLARIONCALL OF HIS THAT WENT TO MY HEART 
IT STILL RANG IN MY EARS  AND I FELT THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT
AGAINAND TO SEE AGAIN THAT GLINT OF LAUGHTER IN HIS EYES THAT BELIED
THE IMPASSIONED SERIOUSNESS OF HIS FACE  AND THERE WERE FURTHER REACHES
OF VAGUE AND INDETERMINATE FEELINGS THAT STIRRED IN ME  I ALMOST LOVED
HIM THEN  THOUGH I AM CONFIDENT  HAD I NEVER SEEN HIM AGAIN  THAT THE
VAGUE FEELINGS WOULD HAVE PASSED AWAY AND THAT I SHOULD EASILY HAVE
FORGOTTEN HIM 

BUT I WAS NOT DESTINED NEVER TO SEE HIM AGAIN  MY FATHERS NEWBORN
INTEREST IN SOCIOLOGY AND THE DINNER PARTIES HE GAVE WOULD NOT PERMIT 
FATHER WAS NOT A SOCIOLOGIST  HIS MARRIAGE WITH MY MOTHER HAD BEEN VERY
HAPPY  AND IN THE RESEARCHES OF HIS OWN SCIENCE  PHYSICS  HE HAD BEEN
VERY HAPPY  BUT WHEN MOTHER DIED  HIS OWN WORK COULD NOT FILL THE
EMPTINESS  AT FIRST  IN A MILD WAY  HE HAD DABBLED IN PHILOSOPHY THEN 
BECOMING INTERESTED  HE HAD DRIFTED ON INTO ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY  HE
HAD A STRONG SENSE OF JUSTICE  AND HE SOON BECAME FIRED WITH A PASSION
TO REDRESS WRONG  IT WAS WITH GRATITUDE THAT I HAILED THESE SIGNS OF A
NEW INTEREST IN LIFE  THOUGH I LITTLE DREAMED WHAT THE OUTCOME WOULD
BE  WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF A BOY HE PLUNGED EXCITEDLY INTO THESE NEW
PURSUITS  REGARDLESS OF WHITHER THEY LED HIM 

HE HAD BEEN USED ALWAYS TO THE LABORATORY  AND SO IT WAS THAT HE TURNED
THE DINING ROOM INTO A SOCIOLOGICAL LABORATORY  HERE CAME TO DINNER
ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF MEN SCIENTISTS  POLITICIANS  BANKERS 
MERCHANTS  PROFESSORS  LABOR LEADERS  SOCIALISTS  AND ANARCHISTS  HE
STIRRED THEM TO DISCUSSION  AND ANALYZED THEIR THOUGHTS OF LIFE AND
SOCIETY 

HE HAD MET ERNEST SHORTLY PRIOR TO THE PREACHERS NIGHT  AND AFTER THE
GUESTS WERE GONE  I LEARNED HOW HE HAD MET HIM  PASSING DOWN A STREET AT
NIGHT AND STOPPING TO LISTEN TO A MAN ON A SOAPBOX WHO WAS ADDRESSING
A CROWD OF WORKINGMEN  THE MAN ON THE BOX WAS ERNEST  NOT THAT HE WAS
A MERE SOAPBOX ORATOR  HE STOOD HIGH IN THE COUNCILS OF THE SOCIALIST
PARTY  WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS  AND WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGED LEADER IN THE
PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIALISM  BUT HE HAD A CERTAIN CLEAR WAY OF STATING THE
ABSTRUSE IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE  WAS A BORN EXPOSITOR AND TEACHER  AND
WAS NOT ABOVE THE SOAPBOX AS A MEANS OF INTERPRETING ECONOMICS TO THE
WORKINGMEN 

MY FATHER STOPPED TO LISTEN  BECAME INTERESTED  EFFECTED A MEETING  AND 
AFTER QUITE AN ACQUAINTANCE  INVITED HIM TO THE MINISTERS DINNER  IT
WAS AFTER THE DINNER THAT FATHER TOLD ME WHAT LITTLE HE KNEW ABOUT HIM 
HE HAD BEEN BORN IN THE WORKING CLASS  THOUGH HE WAS A DESCENDANT OF
THE OLD LINE OF EVERHARDS THAT FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS HAD LIVED
IN AMERICA  AT TEN YEARS OF AGE HE HAD GONE TO WORK IN THE MILLS 
AND LATER HE SERVED HIS APPRENTICESHIP AND BECAME A HORSESHOER  HE WAS
SELFEDUCATED  HAD TAUGHT HIMSELF GERMAN AND FRENCH  AND AT THAT TIME
WAS EARNING A MEAGRE LIVING BY TRANSLATING SCIENTIFIC AND PHILOSOPHICAL
WORKS FOR A STRUGGLING SOCIALIST PUBLISHING HOUSE IN CHICAGO  ALSO  HIS
EARNINGS WERE ADDED TO BY THE ROYALTIES FROM THE SMALL SALES OF HIS OWN
ECONOMIC AND PHILOSOPHIC WORKS 

      THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN BEING NATIVE BORN AND FOREIGN BORN
     WAS SHARP AND INVIDIOUS IN THOSE DAYS 

THIS MUCH I LEARNED OF HIM BEFORE I WENT TO BED  AND I LAY LONG AWAKE 
LISTENING IN MEMORY TO THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE  I GREW FRIGHTENED AT
MY THOUGHTS  HE WAS SO UNLIKE THE MEN OF MY OWN CLASS  SO ALIEN AND SO
STRONG  HIS MASTERFULNESS DELIGHTED ME AND TERRIFIED ME  FOR MY FANCIES
WANTONLY ROVED UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF CONSIDERING HIM AS A LOVER  AS A
HUSBAND  I HAD ALWAYS HEARD THAT THE STRENGTH OF MEN WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE
ATTRACTION TO WOMEN BUT HE WAS TOO STRONG  NO NO I CRIED OUT  IT
IS IMPOSSIBLE  ABSURD AND ON THE MORROW I AWOKE TO FIND IN MYSELF
A LONGING TO SEE HIM AGAIN  I WANTED TO SEE HIM MASTERING MEN IN
DISCUSSION  THE WARNOTE IN HIS VOICE TO SEE HIM  IN ALL HIS CERTITUDE
AND STRENGTH  SHATTERING THEIR COMPLACENCY  SHAKING THEM OUT OF THEIR
RUTS OF THINKING  WHAT IF HE DID SWASHBUCKLE TO USE HIS OWN PHRASE  IT
WORKED  IT PRODUCED EFFECTS  AND  BESIDES  HIS SWASHBUCKLING WAS A FINE
THING TO SEE  IT STIRRED ONE LIKE THE ONSET OF BATTLE 

SEVERAL DAYS PASSED DURING WHICH I READ ERNESTS BOOKS  BORROWED FROM MY
FATHER  HIS WRITTEN WORD WAS AS HIS SPOKEN WORD  CLEAR AND CONVINCING 
IT WAS ITS ABSOLUTE SIMPLICITY THAT CONVINCED EVEN WHILE ONE CONTINUED
TO DOUBT  HE HAD THE GIFT OF LUCIDITY  HE WAS THE PERFECT EXPOSITOR 
YET  IN SPITE OF HIS STYLE  THERE WAS MUCH THAT I DID NOT LIKE  HE LAID
TOO GREAT STRESS ON WHAT HE CALLED THE CLASS STRUGGLE  THE ANTAGONISM
BETWEEN LABOR AND CAPITAL  THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST 

FATHER REPORTED WITH GLEE DR  HAMMERFIELDS JUDGMENT OF ERNEST  WHICH
WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT HE WAS AN INSOLENT YOUNG PUPPY  MADE BUMPTIOUS
BY A LITTLE AND VERY INADEQUATE LEARNING  ALSO  DR  HAMMERFIELD
DECLINED TO MEET ERNEST AGAIN 

BUT BISHOP MOREHOUSE TURNED OUT TO HAVE BECOME INTERESTED IN ERNEST 
AND WAS ANXIOUS FOR ANOTHER MEETING  A STRONG YOUNG MAN  HE SAID AND
VERY MUCH ALIVE  VERY MUCH ALIVE  BUT HE IS TOO SURE  TOO SURE 

ERNEST CAME ONE AFTERNOON WITH FATHER  THE BISHOP HAD ALREADY ARRIVED 
AND WE WERE HAVING TEA ON THE VERANDA  ERNESTS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN
BERKELEY  BY THE WAY  WAS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE FACT THAT HE WAS TAKING
SPECIAL COURSES IN BIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY  AND ALSO THAT HE WAS HARD
AT WORK ON A NEW BOOK ENTITLED PHILOSOPHY AND REVOLUTION 

      THIS BOOK CONTINUED TO BE SECRETLY PRINTED THROUGHOUT THE
     THREE CENTURIES OF THE IRON HEEL   THERE ARE SEVERAL COPIES
     OF VARIOUS EDITIONS IN THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF ARDIS 

THE VERANDA SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE BECOME SMALL WHEN ERNEST ARRIVED 
NOT THAT HE WAS SO VERY LARGEHE STOOD ONLY FIVE FEET NINE INCHES BUT
THAT HE SEEMED TO RADIATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF LARGENESS  AS HE STOPPED TO
MEET ME  HE BETRAYED A CERTAIN SLIGHT AWKWARDNESS THAT WAS STRANGELY AT
VARIANCE WITH HIS BOLDLOOKING EYES AND HIS FIRM  SURE HAND THAT CLASPED
FOR A MOMENT IN GREETING  AND IN THAT MOMENT HIS EYES WERE JUST AS
STEADY AND SURE  THERE SEEMED A QUESTION IN THEM THIS TIME  AND AS
BEFORE HE LOOKED AT ME OVER LONG 

I HAVE BEEN READING YOUR WORKINGCLASS PHILOSOPHY  I SAID  AND HIS
EYES LIGHTED IN A PLEASED WAY 

OF COURSE  HE ANSWERED  YOU TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE AUDIENCE TO
WHICH IT WAS ADDRESSED 

I DID  AND IT IS BECAUSE I DID THAT I HAVE A QUARREL WITH YOU  I
CHALLENGED 

I  TOO  HAVE A QUARREL WITH YOU  MR  EVERHARD  BISHOP MOREHOUSE SAID 

ERNEST SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WHIMSICALLY AND ACCEPTED A CUP OF TEA 

THE BISHOP BOWED AND GAVE ME PRECEDENCE 

YOU FOMENT CLASS HATRED  I SAID  I CONSIDER IT WRONG AND CRIMINAL
TO APPEAL TO ALL THAT IS NARROW AND BRUTAL IN THE WORKING CLASS  CLASS
HATRED IS ANTISOCIAL  AND  IT SEEMS TO ME  ANTISOCIALISTIC 

NOT GUILTY  HE ANSWERED  CLASS HATRED IS NEITHER IN THE TEXT NOR IN
THE SPIRIT OF ANYTHING I HAVE EVERY WRITTEN 

OH I CRIED REPROACHFULLY  AND REACHED FOR HIS BOOK AND OPENED IT 

HE SIPPED HIS TEA AND SMILED AT ME WHILE I RAN OVER THE PAGES 

PAGE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTYTWO  I READ ALOUD  THE CLASS STRUGGLE 
THEREFORE  PRESENTS ITSELF IN THE PRESENT STAGE OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT
BETWEEN THE WAGEPAYING AND THE WAGEPAID CLASSES 

I LOOKED AT HIM TRIUMPHANTLY 

NO MENTION THERE OF CLASS HATRED  HE SMILED BACK 

BUT  I ANSWERED  YOU SAY CLASS STRUGGLE 

A DIFFERENT THING FROM CLASS HATRED  HE REPLIED  AND  BELIEVE ME 
WE FOMENT NO HATRED  WE SAY THAT THE CLASS STRUGGLE IS A LAW OF SOCIAL
DEVELOPMENT  WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR IT  WE DO NOT MAKE THE CLASS
STRUGGLE  WE MERELY EXPLAIN IT  AS NEWTON EXPLAINED GRAVITATION  WE
EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT PRODUCES THE CLASS
STRUGGLE 

BUT THERE SHOULD BE NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST I CRIED 

I AGREE WITH YOU HEARTILY  HE ANSWERED  THAT IS WHAT WE SOCIALISTS
ARE TRYING TO BRING ABOUT THE ABOLITION OF THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
PARDON ME  LET ME READ AN EXTRACT  HE TOOK HIS BOOK AND TURNED BACK
SEVERAL PAGES  PAGE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTYSIX  THE CYCLE OF CLASS
STRUGGLES WHICH BEGAN WITH THE DISSOLUTION OF RUDE  TRIBAL COMMUNISM
AND THE RISE OF PRIVATE PROPERTY WILL END WITH THE PASSING OF PRIVATE
PROPERTY IN THE MEANS OF SOCIAL EXISTENCE 

BUT I DISAGREE WITH YOU  THE BISHOP INTERPOSED  HIS PALE  ASCETIC FACE
BETRAYING BY A FAINT GLOW THE INTENSITY OF HIS FEELINGS  YOUR PREMISE
IS WRONG  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN LABOR
AND CAPITALOR  RATHER  THERE OUGHT NOT TO BE 

THANK YOU  ERNEST SAID GRAVELY  BY THAT LAST STATEMENT YOU HAVE GIVEN
ME BACK MY PREMISE 

BUT WHY SHOULD THERE BE A CONFLICT THE BISHOP DEMANDED WARMLY 

ERNEST SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS  BECAUSE WE ARE SO MADE  I GUESS 

BUT WE ARE NOT SO MADE CRIED THE OTHER 

ARE YOU DISCUSSING THE IDEAL MAN ERNEST ASKED  UNSELFISH AND
GODLIKE  AND SO FEW IN NUMBERS AS TO BE PRACTICALLY NONEXISTENT  OR ARE
YOU DISCUSSING THE COMMON AND ORDINARY AVERAGE MAN

THE COMMON AND ORDINARY MAN  WAS THE ANSWER 

WHO IS WEAK AND FALLIBLE  PRONE TO ERROR

BISHOP MOREHOUSE NODDED 

AND PETTY AND SELFISH

AGAIN HE NODDED 

WATCH OUT ERNEST WARNED  I SAID SELFISH 

THE AVERAGE MAN IS SELFISH  THE BISHOP AFFIRMED VALIANTLY 

WANTS ALL HE CAN GET

WANTS ALL HE CAN GETTRUE BUT DEPLORABLE 

THEN IVE GOT YOU  ERNESTS JAW SNAPPED LIKE A TRAP  LET ME SHOW YOU 
HERE IS A MAN WHO WORKS ON THE STREET RAILWAYS 

HE COULDNT WORK IF IT WERENT FOR CAPITAL  THE BISHOP INTERRUPTED 

TRUE  AND YOU WILL GRANT THAT CAPITAL WOULD PERISH IF THERE WERE NO
LABOR TO EARN THE DIVIDENDS 

THE BISHOP WAS SILENT 

WONT YOU ERNEST INSISTED 

THE BISHOP NODDED 

THEN OUR STATEMENTS CANCEL EACH OTHER  ERNEST SAID IN A MATTEROFFACT
TONE  AND WE ARE WHERE WE WERE  NOW TO BEGIN AGAIN  THE WORKINGMEN
ON THE STREET RAILWAY FURNISH THE LABOR  THE STOCKHOLDERS FURNISH THE
CAPITAL  BY THE JOINT EFFORT OF THE WORKINGMEN AND THE CAPITAL  MONEY IS
EARNED  THEY DIVIDE BETWEEN THEM THIS MONEY THAT IS EARNED  CAPITALS
SHARE IS CALLED DIVIDENDS  LABORS SHARE IS CALLED WAGES 

      IN THOSE DAYS  GROUPS OF PREDATORY INDIVIDUALS CONTROLLED
     ALL THE MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION  AND FOR THE USE OF SAME
     LEVIED TOLL UPON THE PUBLIC 

VERY GOOD  THE BISHOP INTERPOSED  AND THERE IS NO REASON THAT THE
DIVISION SHOULD NOT BE AMICABLE 

YOU HAVE ALREADY FORGOTTEN WHAT WE HAD AGREED UPON  ERNEST REPLIED 
WE AGREED THAT THE AVERAGE MAN IS SELFISH  HE IS THE MAN THAT IS  YOU
HAVE GONE UP IN THE AIR AND ARE ARRANGING A DIVISION BETWEEN THE KIND
OF MEN THAT OUGHT TO BE BUT ARE NOT  BUT TO RETURN TO THE EARTH  THE
WORKINGMAN  BEING SELFISH  WANTS ALL HE CAN GET IN THE DIVISION  THE
CAPITALIST  BEING SELFISH  WANTS ALL HE CAN GET IN THE DIVISION  WHEN
THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH OF THE SAME THING  AND WHEN TWO MEN WANT ALL THEY
CAN GET OF THE SAME THING  THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN LABOR
AND CAPITAL  AND IT IS AN IRRECONCILABLE CONFLICT  AS LONG AS WORKINGMEN
AND CAPITALISTS EXIST  THEY WILL CONTINUE TO QUARREL OVER THE DIVISION 
IF YOU WERE IN SAN FRANCISCO THIS AFTERNOON  YOUD HAVE TO WALK  THERE
ISNT A STREET CAR RUNNING 

ANOTHER STRIKE THE BISHOP QUERIED WITH ALARM 

      THESE QUARRELS WERE VERY COMMON IN THOSE IRRATIONAL AND
     ANARCHIC TIMES   SOMETIMES THE LABORERS REFUSED TO WORK 
     SOMETIMES THE CAPITALISTS REFUSED TO LET THE LABORERS WORK 
     IN THE VIOLENCE AND TURBULENCE OF SUCH DISAGREEMENTS MUCH
     PROPERTY WAS DESTROYED AND MANY LIVES LOST   ALL THIS IS
     INCONCEIVABLE TO USAS INCONCEIVABLE AS ANOTHER CUSTOM OF
     THAT TIME  NAMELY  THE HABIT THE MEN OF THE LOWER CLASSES
     HAD OF BREAKING THE FURNITURE WHEN THEY QUARRELLED WITH
     THEIR WIVES 

YES  THEYRE QUARRELLING OVER THE DIVISION OF THE EARNINGS OF THE
STREET RAILWAYS 

BISHOP MOREHOUSE BECAME EXCITED 

IT IS WRONG HE CRIED  IT IS SO SHORTSIGHTED ON THE PART OF THE
WORKINGMEN  HOW CAN THEY HOPE TO KEEP OUR SYMPATHY

WHEN WE ARE COMPELLED TO WALK  ERNEST SAID SLYLY 

BUT BISHOP MOREHOUSE IGNORED HIM AND WENT ON 

THEIR OUTLOOK IS TOO NARROW  MEN SHOULD BE MEN  NOT BRUTES  THERE WILL
BE VIOLENCE AND MURDER NOW  AND SORROWING WIDOWS AND ORPHANS  CAPITAL
AND LABOR SHOULD BE FRIENDS  THEY SHOULD WORK HAND IN HAND AND TO THEIR
MUTUAL BENEFIT 

AH  NOW YOU ARE UP IN THE AIR AGAIN  ERNEST REMARKED DRYLY  COME BACK
TO EARTH  REMEMBER  WE AGREED THAT THE AVERAGE MAN IS SELFISH 

BUT HE OUGHT NOT TO BE THE BISHOP CRIED 

AND THERE I AGREE WITH YOU  WAS ERNESTS REJOINDER  HE OUGHT NOT TO
BE SELFISH  BUT HE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SELFISH AS LONG AS HE LIVES IN A
SOCIAL SYSTEM THAT IS BASED ON PIGETHICS 

THE BISHOP WAS AGHAST  AND MY FATHER CHUCKLED 

YES  PIGETHICS  ERNEST WENT ON REMORSELESSLY  THAT IS THE MEANING
OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM  AND THAT IS WHAT YOUR CHURCH IS STANDING
FOR  WHAT YOU ARE PREACHING FOR EVERY TIME YOU GET UP IN THE PULPIT 
PIGETHICS THERE IS NO OTHER NAME FOR IT 

BISHOP MOREHOUSE TURNED APPEALINGLY TO MY FATHER  BUT HE LAUGHED AND
NODDED HIS HEAD 

IM AFRAID MR  EVERHARD IS RIGHT  HE SAID  LAISSEZFAIRE  THE
LETALONE POLICY OF EACH FOR HIMSELF AND DEVIL TAKE THE HINDMOST  AS MR 
EVERHARD SAID THE OTHER NIGHT  THE FUNCTION YOU CHURCHMEN PERFORM IS TO
MAINTAIN THE ESTABLISHED ORDER OF SOCIETY  AND SOCIETY IS ESTABLISHED ON
THAT FOUNDATION 

BUT THAT IS NOT THE TEACHING OF CHRIST CRIED THE BISHOP 

THE CHURCH IS NOT TEACHING CHRIST THESE DAYS  ERNEST PUT IN QUICKLY 
THAT IS WHY THE WORKINGMEN WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHURCH 
THE CHURCH CONDONES THE FRIGHTFUL BRUTALITY AND SAVAGERY WITH WHICH THE
CAPITALIST CLASS TREATS THE WORKING CLASS 

THE CHURCH DOES NOT CONDONE IT  THE BISHOP OBJECTED 

THE CHURCH DOES NOT PROTEST AGAINST IT  ERNEST REPLIED  AND IN SO FAR
AS THE CHURCH DOES NOT PROTEST  IT CONDONES  FOR REMEMBER THE CHURCH IS
SUPPORTED BY THE CAPITALIST CLASS 

I HAD NOT LOOKED AT IT IN THAT LIGHT  THE BISHOP SAID NAIVELY  YOU
MUST BE WRONG  I KNOW THAT THERE IS MUCH THAT IS SAD AND WICKED IN
THIS WORLD  I KNOW THAT THE CHURCH HAS LOST THEWHAT YOU CALL THE
PROLETARIAT 

      PROLETARIAT  DERIVED ORIGINALLY FROM THE LATIN PROLETARII 
     THE NAME GIVEN IN THE CENSUS OF SERVIUS TULLIUS TO THOSE WHO
     WERE OF VALUE TO THE STATE ONLY AS THE REARERS OF OFFSPRING
     PROLES IN OTHER WORDS  THEY WERE OF NO IMPORTANCE EITHER
     FOR WEALTH  OR POSITION  OR EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY 

YOU NEVER HAD THE PROLETARIAT  ERNEST CRIED  THE PROLETARIAT HAS
GROWN UP OUTSIDE THE CHURCH AND WITHOUT THE CHURCH 

I DO NOT FOLLOW YOU  THE BISHOP SAID FAINTLY 

THEN LET ME EXPLAIN  WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF MACHINERY AND THE FACTORY
SYSTEM IN THE LATTER PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY  THE GREAT MASS OF
THE WORKING PEOPLE WAS SEPARATED FROM THE LAND  THE OLD SYSTEM OF LABOR
WAS BROKEN DOWN  THE WORKING PEOPLE WERE DRIVEN FROM THEIR VILLAGES AND
HERDED IN FACTORY TOWNS  THE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN WERE PUT TO WORK AT
THE NEW MACHINES  FAMILY LIFE CEASED  THE CONDITIONS WERE FRIGHTFUL  IT
IS A TALE OF BLOOD 

I KNOW  I KNOW  BISHOP MOREHOUSE INTERRUPTED WITH AN AGONIZED
EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE  IT WAS TERRIBLE  BUT IT OCCURRED A CENTURY AND
A HALF AGO 

AND THERE  A CENTURY AND A HALF AGO  ORIGINATED THE MODERN
PROLETARIAT  ERNEST CONTINUED  AND THE CHURCH IGNORED IT  WHILE A
SLAUGHTERHOUSE WAS MADE OF THE NATION BY THE CAPITALIST  THE CHURCH
WAS DUMB  IT DID NOT PROTEST  AS TODAY IT DOES NOT PROTEST  AS AUSTIN
LEWIS SAYS  SPEAKING OF THAT TIME  THOSE TO WHOM THE COMMAND FEED MY
LAMBS HAD BEEN GIVEN  SAW THOSE LAMBS SOLD INTO SLAVERY AND WORKED TO
DEATH WITHOUT A PROTEST  THE CHURCH WAS DUMB  THEN  AND BEFORE I GO ON
I WANT YOU EITHER FLATLY TO AGREE WITH ME OR FLATLY TO DISAGREE WITH ME 
WAS THE CHURCH DUMB THEN

      CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA ON THE SOCIALIST
     TICKET IN THE FALL ELECTION OF  CHRISTIAN ERA   AN
     ENGLISHMAN BY BIRTH  A WRITER OF MANY BOOKS ON POLITICAL
     ECONOMY AND PHILOSOPHY  AND ONE OF THE SOCIALIST LEADERS OF
     THE TIMES 

      THERE IS NO MORE HORRIBLE PAGE IN HISTORY THAN THE
     TREATMENT OF THE CHILD AND WOMEN SLAVES IN THE ENGLISH
     FACTORIES IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY OF
     THE CHRISTIAN ERA   IN SUCH INDUSTRIAL HELLS AROSE SOME OF
     THE PROUDEST FORTUNES OF THAT DAY 

BISHOP MOREHOUSE HESITATED  LIKE DR  HAMMERFIELD  HE WAS UNUSED TO THIS
FIERCE INFIGHTING  AS ERNEST CALLED IT 

THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN  ERNEST PROMPTED  IF
THE CHURCH WAS NOT DUMB  IT WILL BE FOUND NOT DUMB IN THE BOOKS 

I AM AFRAID THE CHURCH WAS DUMB  THE BISHOP CONFESSED 

AND THE CHURCH IS DUMB TODAY 

THERE I DISAGREE  SAID THE BISHOP 

ERNEST PAUSED  LOOKED AT HIM SEARCHINGLY  AND ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE 

ALL RIGHT  HE SAID  LET US SEE  IN CHICAGO THERE ARE WOMEN WHO TOIL
ALL THE WEEK FOR NINETY CENTS  HAS THE CHURCH PROTESTED

THIS IS NEWS TO ME  WAS THE ANSWER  NINETY CENTS PER WEEK IT IS
HORRIBLE

HAS THE CHURCH PROTESTED ERNEST INSISTED 

THE CHURCH DOES NOT KNOW  THE BISHOP WAS STRUGGLING HARD 

YET THE COMMAND TO THE CHURCH WAS  FEED MY LAMBS  ERNEST SNEERED 
AND THEN  THE NEXT MOMENT  PARDON MY SNEER  BISHOP  BUT CAN YOU
WONDER THAT WE LOSE PATIENCE WITH YOU WHEN HAVE YOU PROTESTED TO YOUR
CAPITALISTIC CONGREGATIONS AT THE WORKING OF CHILDREN IN THE SOUTHERN
COTTON MILLS CHILDREN  SIX AND SEVEN YEARS OF AGE  WORKING EVERY NIGHT
AT TWELVEHOUR SHIFTS THEY NEVER SEE THE BLESSED SUNSHINE  THEY DIE
LIKE FLIES  THE DIVIDENDS ARE PAID OUT OF THEIR BLOOD  AND OUT OF THE
DIVIDENDS MAGNIFICENT CHURCHES ARE BUILDED IN NEW ENGLAND  WHEREIN YOUR
KIND PREACHES PLEASANT PLATITUDES TO THE SLEEK  FULLBELLIED RECIPIENTS
OF THOSE DIVIDENDS 

      EVERHARD MIGHT HAVE DRAWN A BETTER ILLUSTRATION FROM THE
     SOUTHERN CHURCHS OUTSPOKEN DEFENCE OF CHATTEL SLAVERY PRIOR
     TO WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE WAR OF THE REBELLION   SEVERAL
     SUCH ILLUSTRATIONS  CULLED FROM THE DOCUMENTS OF THE TIMES 
     ARE HERE APPENDED   IN  A D   THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF
     THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH RESOLVED THAT  SLAVERY IS
     RECOGNIZED IN BOTH THE OLD AND THE NEW TESTAMENTS  AND IS
     NOT CONDEMNED BY THE AUTHORITY OF GOD   THE CHARLESTON
     BAPTIST ASSOCIATION ISSUED THE FOLLOWING  IN AN ADDRESS  IN
      A D   THE RIGHT OF MASTERS TO DISPOSE OF THE TIME OF
     THEIR SLAVES HAS BEEN DISTINCTLY RECOGNIZED BY THE CREATOR
     OF ALL THINGS  WHO IS SURELY AT LIBERTY TO VEST THE RIGHT OF
     PROPERTY OVER ANY OBJECT WHOMSOEVER HE PLEASES   THE REV 
     E  D  SIMON  DOCTOR OF DIVINITY AND PROFESSOR IN THE
     RANDOLPHMACON METHODIST COLLEGE OF VIRGINIA  WROTE 
     EXTRACTS FROM HOLY WRIT UNEQUIVOCALLY ASSERT THE RIGHT OF
     PROPERTY IN SLAVES  TOGETHER WITH THE USUAL INCIDENTS TO
     THAT RIGHT   THE RIGHT TO BUY AND SELL IS CLEARLY STATED 
     UPON THE WHOLE  THEN  WHETHER WE CONSULT THE JEWISH POLICY
     INSTITUTED BY GOD HIMSELF  OR THE UNIFORM OPINION AND
     PRACTICE OF MANKIND IN ALL AGES  OR THE INJUNCTIONS OF THE
     NEW TESTAMENT AND THE MORAL LAW  WE ARE BROUGHT TO THE
     CONCLUSION THAT SLAVERY IS NOT IMMORAL   HAVING ESTABLISHED
     THE POINT THAT THE FIRST AFRICAN SLAVES WERE LEGALLY BROUGHT
     INTO BONDAGE  THE RIGHT TO DETAIN THEIR CHILDREN IN BONDAGE
     FOLLOWS AS AN INDISPENSABLE CONSEQUENCE   THUS WE SEE THAT
     THE SLAVERY THAT EXISTS IN AMERICA WAS FOUNDED IN RIGHT 

     IT IS NOT AT ALL REMARKABLE THAT THIS SAME NOTE SHOULD HAVE
     BEEN STRUCK BY THE CHURCH A GENERATION OR SO LATER IN
     RELATION TO THE DEFENCE OF CAPITALISTIC PROPERTY   IN THE
     GREAT MUSEUM AT ASGARD THERE IS A BOOK ENTITLED ESSAYS IN
     APPLICATION  WRITTEN BY HENRY VAN DYKE   THE BOOK WAS
     PUBLISHED IN  OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA  FROM WHAT WE CAN
     MAKE OUT  VAN DYKE MUST HAVE BEEN A CHURCHMAN  THE BOOK IS A
     GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT EVERHARD WOULD HAVE CALLED BOURGEOIS
     THINKING   NOTE THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE UTTERANCE OF THE
     CHARLESTON BAPTIST ASSOCIATION QUOTED ABOVE  AND THE
     FOLLOWING UTTERANCE OF VAN DYKE SEVENTY YEARS LATER  THE
     BIBLE TEACHES THAT GOD OWNS THE WORLD   HE DISTRIBUTES TO
     EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS OWN GOOD PLEASURE  CONFORMABLY TO
     GENERAL LAWS 

I DID NOT KNOW  THE BISHOP MURMURED FAINTLY  HIS FACE WAS PALE  AND HE
SEEMED SUFFERING FROM NAUSEA 

THEN YOU HAVE NOT PROTESTED

THE BISHOP SHOOK HIS HEAD 

THEN THE CHURCH IS DUMB TODAY  AS IT WAS IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY

THE BISHOP WAS SILENT  AND FOR ONCE ERNEST FORBORE TO PRESS THE POINT 

AND DO NOT FORGET  WHENEVER A CHURCHMAN DOES PROTEST  THAT HE IS
DISCHARGED 

I HARDLY THINK THAT IS FAIR  WAS THE OBJECTION 

WILL YOU PROTEST ERNEST DEMANDED 

SHOW ME EVILS  SUCH AS YOU MENTION  IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY  AND I WILL
PROTEST 

ILL SHOW YOU  ERNEST SAID QUIETLY  I AM AT YOUR DISPOSAL  I WILL
TAKE YOU ON A JOURNEY THROUGH HELL 

AND I SHALL PROTEST  THE BISHOP STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF IN HIS CHAIR  AND
OVER HIS GENTLE FACE SPREAD THE HARSHNESS OF THE WARRIOR  THE CHURCH
SHALL NOT BE DUMB

YOU WILL BE DISCHARGED  WAS THE WARNING 

I SHALL PROVE THE CONTRARY  WAS THE RETORT  I SHALL PROVE  IF
WHAT YOU SAY IS SO  THAT THE CHURCH HAS ERRED THROUGH IGNORANCE  AND 
FURTHERMORE  I HOLD THAT WHATEVER IS HORRIBLE IN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY IS
DUE TO THE IGNORANCE OF THE CAPITALIST CLASS  IT WILL MEND ALL THAT IS
WRONG AS SOON AS IT RECEIVES THE MESSAGE  AND THIS MESSAGE IT SHALL BE
THE DUTY OF THE CHURCH TO DELIVER 

ERNEST LAUGHED  HE LAUGHED BRUTALLY  AND I WAS DRIVEN TO THE BISHOPS
DEFENCE 

REMEMBER  I SAID  YOU SEE BUT ONE SIDE OF THE SHIELD  THERE IS
MUCH GOOD IN US  THOUGH YOU GIVE US CREDIT FOR NO GOOD AT ALL  BISHOP
MOREHOUSE IS RIGHT  THE INDUSTRIAL WRONG  TERRIBLE AS YOU SAY IT IS 
IS DUE TO IGNORANCE  THE DIVISIONS OF SOCIETY HAVE BECOME TOO WIDELY
SEPARATED 

THE WILD INDIAN IS NOT SO BRUTAL AND SAVAGE AS THE CAPITALIST CLASS 
HE ANSWERED AND IN THAT MOMENT I HATED HIM 

YOU DO NOT KNOW US  I ANSWERED  WE ARE NOT BRUTAL AND SAVAGE 

PROVE IT  HE CHALLENGED 

HOW CAN I PROVE IT       TO YOU I WAS GROWING ANGRY 

HE SHOOK HIS HEAD  I DO NOT ASK YOU TO PROVE IT TO ME  I ASK YOU TO
PROVE IT TO YOURSELF 

I KNOW  I SAID 

YOU KNOW NOTHING  WAS HIS RUDE REPLY 

THERE  THERE  CHILDREN  FATHER SAID SOOTHINGLY 

I DONT CARE I BEGAN INDIGNANTLY  BUT ERNEST INTERRUPTED 

I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE MONEY  OR YOUR FATHER HAS  WHICH IS THE SAME
THINGMONEY INVESTED IN THE SIERRA MILLS 

WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT I CRIED 

NOTHING MUCH  HE BEGAN SLOWLY  EXCEPT THAT THE GOWN YOU WEAR IS
STAINED WITH BLOOD  THE FOOD YOU EAT IS A BLOODY STEW  THE BLOOD OF
LITTLE CHILDREN AND OF STRONG MEN IS DRIPPING FROM YOUR VERY ROOFBEAMS 
I CAN CLOSE MY EYES  NOW  AND HEAR IT DRIP  DROP  DRIP  DROP  ALL ABOUT
ME 

AND SUITING THE ACTION TO THE WORDS  HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND LEANED BACK
IN HIS CHAIR  I BURST INTO TEARS OF MORTIFICATION AND HURT VANITY  I HAD
NEVER BEEN SO BRUTALLY TREATED IN MY LIFE  BOTH THE BISHOP AND MY FATHER
WERE EMBARRASSED AND PERTURBED  THEY TRIED TO LEAD THE CONVERSATION
AWAY INTO EASIER CHANNELS BUT ERNEST OPENED HIS EYES  LOOKED AT ME 
AND WAVED THEM ASIDE  HIS MOUTH WAS STERN  AND HIS EYES TOO AND IN THE
LATTER THERE WAS NO GLINT OF LAUGHTER  WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO SAY  WHAT
TERRIBLE CASTIGATION HE WAS GOING TO GIVE ME  I NEVER KNEW FOR AT THAT
MOMENT A MAN  PASSING ALONG THE SIDEWALK  STOPPED AND GLANCED IN AT US 
HE WAS A LARGE MAN  POORLY DRESSED  AND ON HIS BACK WAS A GREAT LOAD OF
RATTAN AND BAMBOO STANDS  CHAIRS  AND SCREENS  HE LOOKED AT THE HOUSE AS
IF DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD COME IN AND TRY TO SELL SOME OF HIS
WARES 

THAT MANS NAME IS JACKSON  ERNEST SAID 

WITH THAT STRONG BODY OF HIS HE SHOULD BE AT WORK  AND NOT PEDDLING 
I ANSWERED CURTLY 

      IN THAT DAY THERE WERE MANY THOUSANDS OF THESE POOR
     MERCHANTS CALLED PEDLERS   THEY CARRIED THEIR WHOLE STOCK IN
     TRADE FROM DOOR TO DOOR   IT WAS A MOST WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE
     OF ENERGY  DISTRIBUTION WAS AS CONFUSED AND IRRATIONAL AS
     THE WHOLE GENERAL SYSTEM OF SOCIETY 

NOTICE THE SLEEVE OF HIS LEFT ARM  ERNEST SAID GENTLY 

I LOOKED  AND SAW THAT THE SLEEVE WAS EMPTY 

IT WAS SOME OF THE BLOOD FROM THAT ARM THAT I HEARD DRIPPING FROM YOUR
ROOFBEAMS  ERNEST SAID WITH CONTINUED GENTLENESS  HE LOST HIS ARM IN
THE SIERRA MILLS  AND LIKE A BROKENDOWN HORSE YOU TURNED HIM OUT ON
THE HIGHWAY TO DIE  WHEN I SAY YOU  I MEAN THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE
OFFICIALS THAT YOU AND THE OTHER STOCKHOLDERS PAY TO MANAGE THE MILLS
FOR YOU  IT WAS AN ACCIDENT  IT WAS CAUSED BY HIS TRYING TO SAVE THE
COMPANY A FEW DOLLARS  THE TOOTHED DRUM OF THE PICKER CAUGHT HIS ARM  HE
MIGHT HAVE LET THE SMALL FLINT THAT HE SAW IN THE TEETH GO THROUGH  IT
WOULD HAVE SMASHED OUT A DOUBLE ROW OF SPIKES  BUT HE REACHED FOR THE
FLINT  AND HIS ARM WAS PICKED AND CLAWED TO SHREDS FROM THE FINGER TIPS
TO THE SHOULDER  IT WAS AT NIGHT  THE MILLS WERE WORKING OVERTIME  THEY
PAID A FAT DIVIDEND THAT QUARTER  JACKSON HAD BEEN WORKING MANY HOURS 
AND HIS MUSCLES HAD LOST THEIR RESILIENCY AND SNAP  THEY MADE HIS
MOVEMENTS A BIT SLOW  THAT WAS WHY THE MACHINE CAUGHT HIM  HE HAD A WIFE
AND THREE CHILDREN 

AND WHAT DID THE COMPANY DO FOR HIM I ASKED 

NOTHING  OH  YES  THEY DID DO SOMETHING  THEY SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT THE
DAMAGE SUIT HE BROUGHT WHEN HE CAME OUT OF HOSPITAL  THE COMPANY EMPLOYS
VERY EFFICIENT LAWYERS  YOU KNOW 

YOU HAVE NOT TOLD THE WHOLE STORY  I SAID WITH CONVICTION  OR ELSE
YOU DO NOT KNOW THE WHOLE STORY  MAYBE THE MAN WAS INSOLENT 

INSOLENT HA HA HIS LAUGHTER WAS MEPHISTOPHELIAN  GREAT GOD
INSOLENT AND WITH HIS ARM CHEWED OFF NEVERTHELESS HE WAS A MEEK AND
LOWLY SERVANT  AND THERE IS NO RECORD OF HIS HAVING BEEN INSOLENT 

BUT THE COURTS  I URGED  THE CASE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DECIDED AGAINST
HIM HAD THERE BEEN NO MORE TO THE AFFAIR THAN YOU HAVE MENTIONED 

COLONEL INGRAM IS LEADING COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY  HE IS A SHREWD
LAWYER  ERNEST LOOKED AT ME INTENTLY FOR A MOMENT  THEN WENT ON  ILL
TELL YOU WHAT YOU DO  MISS CUNNINGHAM  YOU INVESTIGATE JACKSONS CASE 

I HAD ALREADY DETERMINED TO  I SAID COLDLY 

ALL RIGHT  HE BEAMED GOODNATUREDLY  AND ILL TELL YOU WHERE TO
FIND HIM  BUT I TREMBLE FOR YOU WHEN I THINK OF ALL YOU ARE TO PROVE BY
JACKSONS ARM 

AND SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT BOTH THE BISHOP AND I ACCEPTED ERNESTS
CHALLENGES  THEY WENT AWAY TOGETHER  LEAVING ME SMARTING WITH A SENSE
OF INJUSTICE THAT HAD BEEN DONE ME AND MY CLASS  THE MAN WAS A BEAST  I
HATED HIM  THEN  AND CONSOLED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HIS BEHAVIOR
WAS WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A MAN OF THE WORKING CLASS 



CHAPTER III

JACKSONS ARM 


LITTLE DID I DREAM THE FATEFUL PART JACKSONS ARM WAS TO PLAY IN MY
LIFE  JACKSON HIMSELF DID NOT IMPRESS ME WHEN I HUNTED HIM OUT  I FOUND
HIM IN A CRAZY  RAMSHACKLE HOUSE DOWN NEAR THE BAY ON THE EDGE OF THE
MARSH  POOLS OF STAGNANT WATER STOOD AROUND THE HOUSE  THEIR SURFACES
COVERED WITH A GREEN AND PUTRIDLOOKING SCUM  WHILE THE STENCH THAT
AROSE FROM THEM WAS INTOLERABLE 

      AN ADJECTIVE DESCRIPTIVE OF RUINED AND DILAPIDATED HOUSES
     IN WHICH GREAT NUMBERS OF THE WORKING PEOPLE FOUND SHELTER
     IN THOSE DAYS   THEY INVARIABLY PAID RENT  AND  CONSIDERING
     THE VALUE OF SUCH HOUSES  ENORMOUS RENT  TO THE LANDLORDS 

I FOUND JACKSON THE MEEK AND LOWLY MAN HE HAD BEEN DESCRIBED  HE WAS
MAKING SOME SORT OF RATTANWORK  AND HE TOILED ON STOLIDLY WHILE I
TALKED WITH HIM  BUT IN SPITE OF HIS MEEKNESS AND LOWLINESS  I FANCIED I
CAUGHT THE FIRST NOTE OF A NASCENT BITTERNESS IN HIM WHEN HE SAID 

THEY MIGHT AGIVEN ME A JOB AS WATCHMAN  ANYWAY 

      IN THOSE DAYS THIEVERY WAS INCREDIBLY PREVALENT 
     EVERYBODY STOLE PROPERTY FROM EVERYBODY ELSE   THE LORDS OF
     SOCIETY STOLE LEGALLY OR ELSE LEGALIZED THEIR STEALING 
     WHILE THE POORER CLASSES STOLE ILLEGALLY   NOTHING WAS SAFE
     UNLESS GUARDED   ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF MEN WERE EMPLOYED AS
     WATCHMEN TO PROTECT PROPERTY   THE HOUSES OF THE WELLTODO
     WERE A COMBINATION OF SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT AND FORTRESS   THE
     APPROPRIATION OF THE PERSONAL BELONGINGS OF OTHERS BY OUR
     OWN CHILDREN OF TODAY IS LOOKED UPON AS A RUDIMENTARY
     SURVIVAL OF THE THEFTCHARACTERISTIC THAT IN THOSE EARLY
     TIMES WAS UNIVERSAL 

I GOT LITTLE OUT OF HIM  HE STRUCK ME AS STUPID  AND YET THE DEFTNESS
WITH WHICH HE WORKED WITH HIS ONE HAND SEEMED TO BELIE HIS STUPIDITY 
THIS SUGGESTED AN IDEA TO ME 

HOW DID YOU HAPPEN TO GET YOUR ARM CAUGHT IN THE MACHINE I ASKED 

HE LOOKED AT ME IN A SLOW AND PONDERING WAY  AND SHOOK HIS HEAD  I
DONT KNOW  IT JUST HAPPENED 

CARELESSNESS I PROMPTED 

NO  HE ANSWERED  I AINT FOR CALLIN IT THAT  I WAS WORKIN OVERTIME 
AN I GUESS I WAS TIRED OUT SOME  I WORKED SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THEM
MILLS  AN IVE TOOK NOTICE THAT MOST OF THE ACCIDENTS HAPPENS JUST
BEFORE WHISTLEBLOW  IM WILLIN TO BET THAT MORE ACCIDENTS HAPPENS
IN THE HOUR BEFORE WHISTLEBLOW THAN IN ALL THE REST OF THE DAY  A MAN
AINT SO QUICK AFTER WORKIN STEADY FOR HOURS  IVE SEEN TOO MANY OF EM
CUT UP AN GOUGED AN CHAWED NOT TO KNOW 

      THE LABORERS WERE CALLED TO WORK AND DISMISSED BY SAVAGE 
     SCREAMING  NERVERACKING STEAMWHISTLES 

MANY OF THEM I QUERIED 

HUNDREDS AN HUNDREDS  AN CHILDREN  TOO 

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TERRIBLE DETAILS  JACKSONS STORY OF HIS
ACCIDENT WAS THE SAME AS THAT I HAD ALREADY HEARD  WHEN I ASKED HIM IF
HE HAD BROKEN SOME RULE OF WORKING THE MACHINERY  HE SHOOK HIS HEAD 

I CHUCKED OFF THE BELT WITH MY RIGHT HAND  HE SAID  AN MADE A REACH
FOR THE FLINT WITH MY LEFT  I DIDNT STOP TO SEE IF THE BELT WAS OFF  I
THOUGHT MY RIGHT HAND HAD DONE ITONLY IT DIDNT  I REACHED QUICK  AND
THE BELT WASNT ALL THE WAY OFF  AND THEN MY ARM WAS CHEWED OFF 

IT MUST HAVE BEEN PAINFUL  I SAID SYMPATHETICALLY 

THE CRUNCHIN OF THE BONES WASNT NICE  WAS HIS ANSWER 

HIS MIND WAS RATHER HAZY CONCERNING THE DAMAGE SUIT  ONLY ONE THING WAS
CLEAR TO HIM  AND THAT WAS THAT HE HAD NOT GOT ANY DAMAGES  HE HAD A
FEELING THAT THE TESTIMONY OF THE FOREMEN AND THE SUPERINTENDENT HAD
BROUGHT ABOUT THE ADVERSE DECISION OF THE COURT  THEIR TESTIMONY  AS HE
PUT IT  WASNT WHAT IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEN  AND TO THEM I RESOLVED TO
GO 

ONE THING WAS PLAIN  JACKSONS SITUATION WAS WRETCHED  HIS WIFE WAS IN
ILL HEALTH  AND HE WAS UNABLE TO EARN  BY HIS RATTANWORK AND PEDDLING 
SUFFICIENT FOOD FOR THE FAMILY  HE WAS BACK IN HIS RENT  AND THE OLDEST
BOY  A LAD OF ELEVEN  HAD STARTED TO WORK IN THE MILLS 

THEY MIGHT AGIVEN ME THAT WATCHMANS JOB  WERE HIS LAST WORDS AS I
WENT AWAY 

BY THE TIME I HAD SEEN THE LAWYER WHO HAD HANDLED JACKSONS CASE  AND
THE TWO FOREMEN AND THE SUPERINTENDENT AT THE MILLS WHO HAD TESTIFIED  I
BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING AFTER ALL IN ERNESTS CONTENTION 

HE WAS A WEAK AND INEFFICIENTLOOKING MAN  THE LAWYER  AND AT SIGHT OF
HIM I DID NOT WONDER THAT JACKSONS CASE HAD BEEN LOST  MY FIRST THOUGHT
WAS THAT IT HAD SERVED JACKSON RIGHT FOR GETTING SUCH A LAWYER  BUT
THE NEXT MOMENT TWO OF ERNESTS STATEMENTS CAME FLASHING INTO MY
CONSCIOUSNESS  THE COMPANY EMPLOYS VERY EFFICIENT LAWYERS AND COLONEL
INGRAM IS A SHREWD LAWYER  I DID SOME RAPID THINKING  IT DAWNED UPON ME
THAT OF COURSE THE COMPANY COULD AFFORD FINER LEGAL TALENT THAN COULD A
WORKINGMAN LIKE JACKSON  BUT THIS WAS MERELY A MINOR DETAIL  THERE WAS
SOME VERY GOOD REASON  I WAS SURE  WHY JACKSONS CASE HAD GONE AGAINST
HIM 

WHY DID YOU LOSE THE CASE I ASKED 

THE LAWYER WAS PERPLEXED AND WORRIED FOR A MOMENT  AND I FOUND IT IN MY
HEART TO PITY THE WRETCHED LITTLE CREATURE  THEN HE BEGAN TO WHINE  I
DO BELIEVE HIS WHINE WAS CONGENITAL  HE WAS A MAN BEATEN AT BIRTH  HE
WHINED ABOUT THE TESTIMONY  THE WITNESSES HAD GIVEN ONLY THE EVIDENCE
THAT HELPED THE OTHER SIDE  NOT ONE WORD COULD HE GET OUT OF THEM THAT
WOULD HAVE HELPED JACKSON  THEY KNEW WHICH SIDE THEIR BREAD WAS BUTTERED
ON  JACKSON WAS A FOOL  HE HAD BEEN BROWBEATEN AND CONFUSED BY COLONEL
INGRAM  COLONEL INGRAM WAS BRILLIANT AT CROSSEXAMINATION  HE HAD MADE
JACKSON ANSWER DAMAGING QUESTIONS 

HOW COULD HIS ANSWERS BE DAMAGING IF HE HAD THE RIGHT ON HIS SIDE I
DEMANDED 

WHATS RIGHT GOT TO DO WITH IT HE DEMANDED BACK  YOU SEE ALL THOSE
BOOKS  HE MOVED HIS HAND OVER THE ARRAY OF VOLUMES ON THE WALLS OF HIS
TINY OFFICE  ALL MY READING AND STUDYING OF THEM HAS TAUGHT ME THAT
LAW IS ONE THING AND RIGHT IS ANOTHER THING  ASK ANY LAWYER  YOU GO TO
SUNDAYSCHOOL TO LEARN WHAT IS RIGHT  BUT YOU GO TO THOSE BOOKS TO LEARN
      LAW 

DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT JACKSON HAD THE RIGHT ON HIS SIDE AND YET
WAS BEATEN I QUERIED TENTATIVELY  DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT THERE
IS NO JUSTICE IN JUDGE CALDWELLS COURT

THE LITTLE LAWYER GLARED AT ME A MOMENT  AND THEN THE BELLIGERENCE FADED
OUT OF HIS FACE 

I HADNT A FAIR CHANCE  HE BEGAN WHINING AGAIN  THEY MADE A FOOL OUT
OF JACKSON AND OUT OF ME  TOO  WHAT CHANCE HAD I COLONEL INGRAM IS
A GREAT LAWYER  IF HE WASNT GREAT  WOULD HE HAVE CHARGE OF THE LAW
BUSINESS OF THE SIERRA MILLS  OF THE ERSTON LAND SYNDICATE  OF THE
BERKELEY CONSOLIDATED  OF THE OAKLAND  SAN LEANDRO  AND PLEASANTON
ELECTRIC HES A CORPORATION LAWYER  AND CORPORATION LAWYERS ARE NOT
PAID FOR BEING FOOLS  WHAT DO YOU THINK THE SIERRA MILLS ALONE GIVE HIM
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR BECAUSE HES WORTH TWENTY THOUSAND
DOLLARS A YEAR TO THEM  THATS WHAT FOR  IM NOT WORTH THAT MUCH  IF
I WAS  I WOULDNT BE ON THE OUTSIDE  STARVING AND TAKING CASES LIKE
JACKSONS  WHAT DO YOU THINK ID HAVE GOT IF ID WON JACKSONS CASE

      THE FUNCTION OF THE CORPORATION LAWYER WAS TO SERVE  BY
     CORRUPT METHODS  THE MONEYGRABBING PROPENSITIES OF THE
     CORPORATIONS   IT IS ON RECORD THAT THEODORE ROOSEVELT  AT
     THAT TIME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  SAID IN  A D  
     IN HIS ADDRESS AT HARVARD COMMENCEMENT  WE ALL KNOW THAT 
     AS THINGS ACTUALLY ARE  MANY OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL AND
     MOST HIGHLY REMUNERATED MEMBERS OF THE BAR IN EVERY CENTRE
     OF WEALTH  MAKE IT THEIR SPECIAL TASK TO WORK OUT BOLD AND
     INGENIOUS SCHEMES BY WHICH THEIR WEALTHY CLIENTS  INDIVIDUAL
     OR CORPORATE  CAN EVADE THE LAWS WHICH WERE MADE TO
     REGULATE  IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC  THE USES OF GREAT
     WEALTH 

YOUD HAVE ROBBED HIM  MOST PROBABLY  I ANSWERED 

OF COURSE I WOULD  HE CRIED ANGRILY  IVE GOT TO LIVE  HAVENT I

      A TYPICAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE INTERNECINE STRIFE THAT
     PERMEATED ALL SOCIETY   MEN PREYED UPON ONE ANOTHER LIKE
     RAVENING WOLVES  THE BIG WOLVES ATE THE LITTLE WOLVES  AND
     IN THE SOCIAL PACK JACKSON WAS ONE OF THE LEAST OF THE
     LITTLE WOLVES 

HE HAS A WIFE AND CHILDREN  I CHIDED 

SO HAVE I A WIFE AND CHILDREN  HE RETORTED  AND THERES NOT A SOUL IN
THIS WORLD EXCEPT MYSELF THAT CARES WHETHER THEY STARVE OR NOT 

HIS FACE SUDDENLY SOFTENED  AND HE OPENED HIS WATCH AND SHOWED ME A
SMALL PHOTOGRAPH OF A WOMAN AND TWO LITTLE GIRLS PASTED INSIDE THE CASE 

THERE THEY ARE  LOOK AT THEM  WEVE HAD A HARD TIME  A HARD TIME  I
HAD HOPED TO SEND THEM AWAY TO THE COUNTRY IF ID WON JACKSONS CASE 
THEYRE NOT HEALTHY HERE  BUT I CANT AFFORD TO SEND THEM AWAY 

WHEN I STARTED TO LEAVE  HE DROPPED BACK INTO HIS WHINE 

I HADNT THE GHOST OF A CHANCE  COLONEL INGRAM AND JUDGE CALDWELL
ARE PRETTY FRIENDLY  IM NOT SAYING THAT IF ID GOT THE RIGHT KIND OF
TESTIMONY OUT OF THEIR WITNESSES ON CROSSEXAMINATION  THAT FRIENDSHIP
WOULD HAVE DECIDED THE CASE  AND YET I MUST SAY THAT JUDGE CALDWELL
DID A WHOLE LOT TO PREVENT MY GETTING THAT VERY TESTIMONY  WHY  JUDGE
CALDWELL AND COLONEL INGRAM BELONG TO THE SAME LODGE AND THE SAME CLUB 
THEY LIVE IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOODONE I CANT AFFORD  AND THEIR WIVES
ARE ALWAYS IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHERS HOUSES  THEYRE ALWAYS HAVING
WHIST PARTIES AND SUCH THINGS BACK AND FORTH 

AND YET YOU THINK JACKSON HAD THE RIGHT OF IT I ASKED  PAUSING FOR
THE MOMENT ON THE THRESHOLD 

I DONT THINK I KNOW IT  WAS HIS ANSWER  AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT
HE HAD SOME SHOW  TOO  BUT I DIDNT TELL MY WIFE  I DIDNT WANT TO
DISAPPOINT HER  SHE HAD HER HEART SET ON A TRIP TO THE COUNTRY HARD
ENOUGH AS IT WAS 

WHY DID YOU NOT CALL ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT JACKSON WAS TRYING TO
SAVE THE MACHINERY FROM BEING INJURED I ASKED PETER DONNELLY  ONE OF
THE FOREMEN WHO HAD TESTIFIED AT THE TRIAL 

HE PONDERED A LONG TIME BEFORE REPLYING  THEN HE CAST AN ANXIOUS LOOK
ABOUT HIM AND SAID 

BECAUSE IVE A GOOD WIFE AN THREE OF THE SWEETEST CHILDREN YE EVER
LAID EYES ON  THATS WHY 

I DO NOT UNDERSTAND  I SAID 

IN OTHER WORDS  BECAUSE IT WOULDNT ABEN HEALTHY  HE ANSWERED 

YOU MEAN I BEGAN 

BUT HE INTERRUPTED PASSIONATELY 

I MEAN WHAT I SAID  ITS LONG YEARS IVE WORKED IN THE MILLS  I BEGAN
AS A LITTLE LAD ON THE SPINDLES  I WORKED UP EVER SINCE  ITS BY HARD
WORK I GOT TO MY PRESENT EXALTED POSITION  IM A FOREMAN  IF YOU PLEASE 
AN I DOUBT ME IF THERES A MAN IN THE MILLS THATD PUT OUT A HAND TO
DRAG ME FROM DROWNIN  I USED TO BELONG TO THE UNION  BUT IVE STAYED
BY THE COMPANY THROUGH TWO STRIKES  THEY CALLED ME SCAB  THERES NOT
A MAN AMONG EM TODAY TO TAKE A DRINK WITH ME IF I ASKED HIM  DYE SEE
THE SCARS ON ME HEAD WHERE I WAS STRUCK WITH FLYING BRICKS THERE AINT
A CHILD AT THE SPINDLES BUT WHAT WOULD CURSE ME NAME  ME ONLY FRIEND IS
THE COMPANY  ITS NOT ME DUTY  BUT ME BREAD AN BUTTER AN THE LIFE OF
ME CHILDREN TO STAND BY THE MILLS  THATS WHY 

WAS JACKSON TO BLAME I ASKED 

HE SHOULD AGOT THE DAMAGES  HE WAS A GOOD WORKER AN NEVER MADE
TROUBLE 

THEN YOU WERE NOT AT LIBERTY TO TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH  AS YOU HAD SWORN
TO DO

HE SHOOK HIS HEAD 

THE TRUTH  THE WHOLE TRUTH  AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH I SAID
SOLEMNLY 

AGAIN HIS FACE BECAME IMPASSIONED  AND HE LIFTED IT  NOT TO ME  BUT TO
HEAVEN 

ID LET ME SOUL AN BODY BURN IN EVERLASTIN HELL FOR THEM CHILDREN OF
MINE  WAS HIS ANSWER 

HENRY DALLAS  THE SUPERINTENDENT  WAS A VULPINEFACED CREATURE WHO
REGARDED ME INSOLENTLY AND REFUSED TO TALK  NOT A WORD COULD I GET FROM
HIM CONCERNING THE TRIAL AND HIS TESTIMONY  BUT WITH THE OTHER FOREMAN I
HAD BETTER LUCK  JAMES SMITH WAS A HARDFACED MAN  AND MY HEART SANK
AS I ENCOUNTERED HIM  HE  TOO  GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS NOT A
FREE AGENT  AS WE TALKED I BEGAN TO SEE THAT HE WAS MENTALLY SUPERIOR
TO THE AVERAGE OF HIS KIND  HE AGREED WITH PETER DONNELLY THAT JACKSON
SHOULD HAVE GOT DAMAGES  AND HE WENT FARTHER AND CALLED THE ACTION
HEARTLESS AND COLDBLOODED THAT HAD TURNED THE WORKER ADRIFT AFTER HE
HAD BEEN MADE HELPLESS BY THE ACCIDENT  ALSO  HE EXPLAINED THAT THERE
WERE MANY ACCIDENTS IN THE MILLS  AND THAT THE COMPANYS POLICY WAS TO
FIGHT TO THE BITTER END ALL CONSEQUENT DAMAGE SUITS 

IT MEANS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS A YEAR TO THE STOCKHOLDERS  HE SAID
AND AS HE SPOKE I REMEMBERED THE LAST DIVIDEND THAT HAD BEEN PAID MY
FATHER  AND THE PRETTY GOWN FOR ME AND THE BOOKS FOR HIM THAT HAD BEEN
BOUGHT OUT OF THAT DIVIDEND  I REMEMBERED ERNESTS CHARGE THAT MY
GOWN WAS STAINED WITH BLOOD  AND MY FLESH BEGAN TO CRAWL UNDERNEATH MY
GARMENTS 

WHEN YOU TESTIFIED AT THE TRIAL  YOU DIDNT POINT OUT THAT JACKSON
RECEIVED HIS ACCIDENT THROUGH TRYING TO SAVE THE MACHINERY FROM DAMAGE
I SAID 

NO  I DID NOT  WAS THE ANSWER  AND HIS MOUTH SET BITTERLY  I
TESTIFIED TO THE EFFECT THAT JACKSON INJURED HIMSELF BY NEGLECT AND
CARELESSNESS  AND THAT THE COMPANY WAS NOT IN ANY WAY TO BLAME OR
LIABLE 

WAS IT CARELESSNESS I ASKED 

CALL IT THAT  OR ANYTHING YOU WANT TO CALL IT  THE FACT IS  A MAN GETS
TIRED AFTER HES BEEN WORKING FOR HOURS 

I WAS BECOMING INTERESTED IN THE MAN  HE CERTAINLY WAS OF A SUPERIOR
KIND 

YOU ARE BETTER EDUCATED THAN MOST WORKINGMEN  I SAID 

I WENT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL  HE REPLIED  I WORKED MY WAY THROUGH DOING
JANITORWORK  I WANTED TO GO THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY  BUT MY FATHER DIED 
AND I CAME TO WORK IN THE MILLS 

I WANTED TO BECOME A NATURALIST  HE EXPLAINED SHYLY  AS THOUGH
CONFESSING A WEAKNESS  I LOVE ANIMALS  BUT I CAME TO WORK IN THE MILLS 
WHEN I WAS PROMOTED TO FOREMAN I GOT MARRIED  THEN THE FAMILY CAME  AND
      WELL  I WASNT MY OWN BOSS ANY MORE 

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT I ASKED 

I WAS EXPLAINING WHY I TESTIFIED AT THE TRIAL THE WAY I DIDWHY I
FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS 

WHOSE INSTRUCTIONS

COLONEL INGRAM  HE OUTLINED THE EVIDENCE I WAS TO GIVE 

AND IT LOST JACKSONS CASE FOR HIM 

HE NODDED  AND THE BLOOD BEGAN TO RISE DARKLY IN HIS FACE 

AND JACKSON HAD A WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN DEPENDENT ON HIM 

I KNOW  HE SAID QUIETLY  THOUGH HIS FACE WAS GROWING DARKER 

TELL ME  I WENT ON  WAS IT EASY TO MAKE YOURSELF OVER FROM WHAT YOU
WERE  SAY IN HIGH SCHOOL  TO THE MAN YOU MUST HAVE BECOME TO DO SUCH A
THING AT THE TRIAL

THE SUDDENNESS OF HIS OUTBURST STARTLED AND FRIGHTENED ME  HE RIPPED
OUT A SAVAGE OATH  AND CLENCHED HIS FIST AS THOUGH ABOUT TO STRIKE ME 

      IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THE VIRILITIES OF LANGUAGE THAT
     WERE COMMON SPEECH IN THAT DAY  AS INDICATIVE OF THE LIFE 
     RED OF CLAW AND FANG  THAT WAS THEN LIVED   REFERENCE IS
     HERE MADE  OF COURSE  NOT TO THE OATH OF SMITH  BUT TO THE
     VERB RIPPED USED BY AVIS EVERHARD 

I BEG YOUR PARDON  HE SAID THE NEXT MOMENT  NO  IT WAS NOT EASY  AND
NOW I GUESS YOU CAN GO AWAY  YOUVE GOT ALL YOU WANTED OUT OF ME  BUT
LET ME TELL YOU THIS BEFORE YOU GO  IT WONT DO YOU ANY GOOD TO REPEAT
ANYTHING IVE SAID  ILL DENY IT  AND THERE ARE NO WITNESSES  ILL DENY
EVERY WORD OF IT AND IF I HAVE TO  ILL DO IT UNDER OATH ON THE WITNESS
STAND 

AFTER MY INTERVIEW WITH SMITH I WENT TO MY FATHERS OFFICE IN
THE CHEMISTRY BUILDING AND THERE ENCOUNTERED ERNEST  IT WAS QUITE
UNEXPECTED  BUT HE MET ME WITH HIS BOLD EYES AND FIRM HANDCLASP  AND
WITH THAT CURIOUS BLEND OF HIS AWKWARDNESS AND EASE  IT WAS AS THOUGH
OUR LAST STORMY MEETING WAS FORGOTTEN BUT I WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO HAVE
IT FORGOTTEN 

I HAVE BEEN LOOKING UP JACKSONS CASE  I SAID ABRUPTLY 

HE WAS ALL INTERESTED ATTENTION  AND WAITED FOR ME TO GO ON  THOUGH I
COULD SEE IN HIS EYES THE CERTITUDE THAT MY CONVICTIONS HAD BEEN SHAKEN 

HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BADLY TREATED  I CONFESSED  IITHINK SOME OF
HIS BLOOD IS DRIPPING FROM OUR ROOFBEAMS 

OF COURSE  HE ANSWERED  IF JACKSON AND ALL HIS FELLOWS WERE TREATED
MERCIFULLY  THE DIVIDENDS WOULD NOT BE SO LARGE 

I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO TAKE PLEASURE IN PRETTY GOWNS AGAIN  I ADDED 

I FELT HUMBLE AND CONTRITE  AND WAS AWARE OF A SWEET FEELING THAT
ERNEST WAS A SORT OF FATHER CONFESSOR  THEN  AS EVER AFTER  HIS STRENGTH
APPEALED TO ME  IT SEEMED TO RADIATE A PROMISE OF PEACE AND PROTECTION 

NOR WILL YOU BE ABLE TO TAKE PLEASURE IN SACKCLOTH  HE SAID GRAVELY 
THERE ARE THE JUTE MILLS  YOU KNOW  AND THE SAME THING GOES ON THERE 
IT GOES ON EVERYWHERE  OUR BOASTED CIVILIZATION IS BASED UPON BLOOD 
SOAKED IN BLOOD  AND NEITHER YOU NOR I NOR ANY OF US CAN ESCAPE THE
SCARLET STAIN  THE MEN YOU TALKED WITHWHO WERE THEY

I TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE 

AND NOT ONE OF THEM WAS A FREE AGENT  HE SAID  THEY WERE ALL TIED TO
THE MERCILESS INDUSTRIAL MACHINE  AND THE PATHOS OF IT AND THE TRAGEDY
IS THAT THEY ARE TIED BY THEIR HEARTSTRINGS  THEIR CHILDRENALWAYS
THE YOUNG LIFE THAT IT IS THEIR INSTINCT TO PROTECT  THIS INSTINCT IS
STRONGER THAN ANY ETHIC THEY POSSESS  MY FATHER HE LIED  HE STOLE  HE
DID ALL SORTS OF DISHONORABLE THINGS TO PUT BREAD INTO MY MOUTH AND INTO
THE MOUTHS OF MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS  HE WAS A SLAVE TO THE INDUSTRIAL
MACHINE  AND IT STAMPED HIS LIFE OUT  WORKED HIM TO DEATH 

BUT YOU  I INTERJECTED  YOU ARE SURELY A FREE AGENT 

NOT WHOLLY  HE REPLIED  I AM NOT TIED BY MY HEARTSTRINGS  I AM OFTEN
THANKFUL THAT I HAVE NO CHILDREN  AND I DEARLY LOVE CHILDREN  YET IF I
MARRIED I SHOULD NOT DARE TO HAVE ANY 

THAT SURELY IS BAD DOCTRINE  I CRIED 

I KNOW IT IS  HE SAID SADLY  BUT IT IS EXPEDIENT DOCTRINE  I AM A
REVOLUTIONIST  AND IT IS A PERILOUS VOCATION 

I LAUGHED INCREDULOUSLY 

IF I TRIED TO ENTER YOUR FATHERS HOUSE AT NIGHT TO STEAL HIS DIVIDENDS
FROM THE SIERRA MILLS  WHAT WOULD HE DO

HE SLEEPS WITH A REVOLVER ON THE STAND BY THE BED  I ANSWERED  HE
WOULD MOST PROBABLY SHOOT YOU 

AND IF I AND A FEW OTHERS SHOULD LEAD A MILLION AND A HALF OF MEN
INTO THE HOUSES OF ALL THE WELLTODO  THERE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL OF
SHOOTING  WOULDNT THERE

      THIS REFERENCE IS TO THE SOCIALIST VOTE CAST IN THE UNITED
     STATES IN    THE RISE OF THIS VOTE CLEARLY INDICATES THE
     SWIFT GROWTH OF THE PARTY OF REVOLUTION   ITS VOTING
     STRENGTH IN THE UNITED STATES IN  WAS  IN  
       IN     IN      AND IN  
        

YES  BUT YOU ARE NOT DOING THAT  I OBJECTED 

IT IS PRECISELY WHAT I AM DOING  AND WE INTEND TO TAKE  NOT THE MERE
WEALTH IN THE HOUSES  BUT ALL THE SOURCES OF THAT WEALTH  ALL THE
MINES  AND RAILROADS  AND FACTORIES  AND BANKS  AND STORES  THAT IS
THE REVOLUTION  IT IS TRULY PERILOUS  THERE WILL BE MORE SHOOTING  I AM
AFRAID  THAN EVEN I DREAM OF  BUT AS I WAS SAYING  NO ONE TODAY IS
A FREE AGENT  WE ARE ALL CAUGHT UP IN THE WHEELS AND COGS OF THE
INDUSTRIAL MACHINE  YOU FOUND THAT YOU WERE  AND THAT THE MEN YOU TALKED
WITH WERE  TALK WITH MORE OF THEM  GO AND SEE COLONEL INGRAM  LOOK
UP THE REPORTERS THAT KEPT JACKSONS CASE OUT OF THE PAPERS  AND THE
EDITORS THAT RUN THE PAPERS  YOU WILL FIND THEM ALL SLAVES OF THE
MACHINE 

A LITTLE LATER IN OUR CONVERSATION I ASKED HIM A SIMPLE LITTLE
QUESTION ABOUT THE LIABILITY OF WORKINGMEN TO ACCIDENTS  AND RECEIVED A
STATISTICAL LECTURE IN RETURN 

IT IS ALL IN THE BOOKS  HE SAID  THE FIGURES HAVE BEEN GATHERED  AND
IT HAS BEEN PROVED CONCLUSIVELY THAT ACCIDENTS RARELY OCCUR IN THE
FIRST HOURS OF THE MORNING WORK  BUT THAT THEY INCREASE RAPIDLY IN THE
SUCCEEDING HOURS AS THE WORKERS GROW TIRED AND SLOWER IN BOTH THEIR
MUSCULAR AND MENTAL PROCESSES 

WHY  DO YOU KNOW THAT YOUR FATHER HAS THREE TIMES AS MANY CHANCES FOR
SAFETY OF LIFE AND LIMB THAN HAS A WORKINGMAN HE HAS  THE INSURANCE
COMPANIES KNOW  THEY WILL CHARGE HIM FOUR DOLLARS AND TWENTY CENTS A
YEAR ON A THOUSANDDOLLAR ACCIDENT POLICY  AND FOR THE SAME POLICY THEY
WILL CHARGE A LABORER FIFTEEN DOLLARS 

      IN THE TERRIBLE WOLFSTRUGGLE OF THOSE CENTURIES  NO MAN
     WAS PERMANENTLY SAFE  NO MATTER HOW MUCH WEALTH HE AMASSED 
     OUT OF FEAR FOR THE WELFARE OF THEIR FAMILIES  MEN DEVISED
     THE SCHEME OF INSURANCE   TO US  IN THIS INTELLIGENT AGE 
     SUCH A DEVICE IS LAUGHABLY ABSURD AND PRIMITIVE   BUT IN
     THAT AGE INSURANCE WAS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER   THE AMUSING
     PART OF IT IS THAT THE FUNDS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE
     FREQUENTLY PLUNDERED AND WASTED BY THE VERY OFFICIALS WHO
     WERE INTRUSTED WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THEM 

AND YOU I ASKED AND IN THE MOMENT OF ASKING I WAS AWARE OF A
SOLICITUDE THAT WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN SLIGHT 

OH  AS A REVOLUTIONIST  I HAVE ABOUT EIGHT CHANCES TO THE WORKINGMANS
ONE OF BEING INJURED OR KILLED  HE ANSWERED CARELESSLY  THE INSURANCE
COMPANIES CHARGE THE HIGHLY TRAINED CHEMISTS THAT HANDLE EXPLOSIVES
EIGHT TIMES WHAT THEY CHARGE THE WORKINGMEN  I DONT THINK THEYD INSURE
ME AT ALL  WHY DID YOU ASK

MY EYES FLUTTERED  AND I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD WARM IN MY FACE  IT
WAS NOT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT ME IN MY SOLICITUDE  BUT THAT I HAD CAUGHT
MYSELF  AND IN HIS PRESENCE 

JUST THEN MY FATHER CAME IN AND BEGAN MAKING PREPARATIONS TO DEPART WITH
ME  ERNEST RETURNED SOME BOOKS HE HAD BORROWED  AND WENT AWAY FIRST  BUT
JUST AS HE WAS GOING  HE TURNED AND SAID 

OH  BY THE WAY  WHILE YOU ARE RUINING YOUR OWN PEACE OF MIND AND I
AM RUINING THE BISHOPS  YOUD BETTER LOOK UP MRS  WICKSON AND
MRS  PERTONWAITHE  THEIR HUSBANDS  YOU KNOW  ARE THE TWO PRINCIPAL
STOCKHOLDERS IN THE MILLS  LIKE ALL THE REST OF HUMANITY  THOSE TWO
WOMEN ARE TIED TO THE MACHINE  BUT THEY ARE SO TIED THAT THEY SIT ON TOP
OF IT 



CHAPTER IV

SLAVES OF THE MACHINE


THE MORE I THOUGHT OF JACKSONS ARM  THE MORE SHAKEN I WAS  I WAS
CONFRONTED BY THE CONCRETE  FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS SEEING LIFE  MY
UNIVERSITY LIFE  AND STUDY AND CULTURE  HAD NOT BEEN REAL  I HAD LEARNED
NOTHING BUT THEORIES OF LIFE AND SOCIETY THAT LOOKED ALL VERY WELL ON
THE PRINTED PAGE  BUT NOW I HAD SEEN LIFE ITSELF  JACKSONS ARM WAS A
FACT OF LIFE  THE FACT  MAN  THE IRREFRAGABLE FACT OF ERNESTS WAS
RINGING IN MY CONSCIOUSNESS 

IT SEEMED MONSTROUS  IMPOSSIBLE  THAT OUR WHOLE SOCIETY WAS BASED
UPON BLOOD  AND YET THERE WAS JACKSON  I COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM HIM 
CONSTANTLY MY THOUGHT SWUNG BACK TO HIM AS THE COMPASS TO THE POLE  HE
HAD BEEN MONSTROUSLY TREATED  HIS BLOOD HAD NOT BEEN PAID FOR IN ORDER
THAT A LARGER DIVIDEND MIGHT BE PAID  AND I KNEW A SCORE OF HAPPY
COMPLACENT FAMILIES THAT HAD RECEIVED THOSE DIVIDENDS AND BY THAT MUCH
HAD PROFITED BY JACKSONS BLOOD  IF ONE MAN COULD BE SO MONSTROUSLY
TREATED AND SOCIETY MOVE ON ITS WAY UNHEEDING  MIGHT NOT MANY MEN BE SO
MONSTROUSLY TREATED I REMEMBERED ERNESTS WOMEN OF CHICAGO WHO TOILED
FOR NINETY CENTS A WEEK  AND THE CHILD SLAVES OF THE SOUTHERN COTTON
MILLS HE HAD DESCRIBED  AND I COULD SEE THEIR WAN WHITE HANDS  FROM
WHICH THE BLOOD HAD BEEN PRESSED  AT WORK UPON THE CLOTH OUT OF WHICH
HAD BEEN MADE MY GOWN  AND THEN I THOUGHT OF THE SIERRA MILLS AND THE
DIVIDENDS THAT HAD BEEN PAID  AND I SAW THE BLOOD OF JACKSON UPON MY
GOWN AS WELL  JACKSON I COULD NOT ESCAPE  ALWAYS MY MEDITATIONS LED ME
BACK TO HIM 

DOWN IN THE DEPTHS OF ME I HAD A FEELING THAT I STOOD ON THE EDGE OF
A PRECIPICE  IT WAS AS THOUGH I WERE ABOUT TO SEE A NEW AND AWFUL
REVELATION OF LIFE  AND NOT I ALONE  MY WHOLE WORLD WAS TURNING OVER 
THERE WAS MY FATHER  I COULD SEE THE EFFECT ERNEST WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE
ON HIM  AND THEN THERE WAS THE BISHOP  WHEN I HAD LAST SEEN HIM HE HAD
LOOKED A SICK MAN  HE WAS AT HIGH NERVOUS TENSION  AND IN HIS EYES THERE
WAS UNSPEAKABLE HORROR  FROM THE LITTLE I LEARNED I KNEW THAT ERNEST HAD
BEEN KEEPING HIS PROMISE OF TAKING HIM THROUGH HELL  BUT WHAT SCENES OF
HELL THE BISHOPS EYES HAD SEEN  I KNEW NOT  FOR HE SEEMED TOO STUNNED
TO SPEAK ABOUT THEM 

ONCE  THE FEELING STRONG UPON ME THAT MY LITTLE WORLD AND ALL THE WORLD
WAS TURNING OVER  I THOUGHT OF ERNEST AS THE CAUSE OF IT AND ALSO I
THOUGHT  WE WERE SO HAPPY AND PEACEFUL BEFORE HE CAME AND THE NEXT
MOMENT I WAS AWARE THAT THE THOUGHT WAS A TREASON AGAINST TRUTH  AND
ERNEST ROSE BEFORE ME TRANSFIGURED  THE APOSTLE OF TRUTH  WITH SHINING
BROWS AND THE FEARLESSNESS OF ONE OF GODS OWN ANGELS  BATTLING FOR THE
TRUTH AND THE RIGHT  AND BATTLING FOR THE SUCCOR OF THE POOR AND LONELY
AND OPPRESSED  AND THEN THERE AROSE BEFORE ME ANOTHER FIGURE  THE
CHRIST HE  TOO  HAD TAKEN THE PART OF THE LOWLY AND OPPRESSED 
AND AGAINST ALL THE ESTABLISHED POWER OF PRIEST AND PHARISEE  AND I
REMEMBERED HIS END UPON THE CROSS  AND MY HEART CONTRACTED WITH A PANG
AS I THOUGHT OF ERNEST  WAS HE  TOO  DESTINED FOR A CROSSHE  WITH HIS
CLARION CALL AND WARNOTED VOICE  AND ALL THE FINE MANS VIGOR OF HIM

AND IN THAT MOMENT I KNEW THAT I LOVED HIM  AND THAT I WAS MELTING
WITH DESIRE TO COMFORT HIM  I THOUGHT OF HIS LIFE  A SORDID  HARSH  AND
MEAGRE LIFE IT MUST HAVE BEEN  AND I THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER  WHO HAD LIED
AND STOLEN FOR HIM AND BEEN WORKED TO DEATH  AND HE HIMSELF HAD GONE
INTO THE MILLS WHEN HE WAS TEN ALL MY HEART SEEMED BURSTING WITH DESIRE
TO FOLD MY ARMS AROUND HIM  AND TO REST HIS HEAD ON MY BREASTHIS HEAD
THAT MUST BE WEARY WITH SO MANY THOUGHTS AND TO GIVE HIM RESTJUST
RESTAND EASEMENT AND FORGETFULNESS FOR A TENDER SPACE 

I MET COLONEL INGRAM AT A CHURCH RECEPTION  HIM I KNEW WELL AND HAD
KNOWN WELL FOR MANY YEARS  I TRAPPED HIM BEHIND LARGE PALMS AND RUBBER
PLANTS  THOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW HE WAS TRAPPED  HE MET ME WITH THE
CONVENTIONAL GAYETY AND GALLANTRY  HE WAS EVER A GRACEFUL MAN 
DIPLOMATIC  TACTFUL  AND CONSIDERATE  AND AS FOR APPEARANCE  HE WAS
THE MOST DISTINGUISHEDLOOKING MAN IN OUR SOCIETY  BESIDE HIM EVEN THE
VENERABLE HEAD OF THE UNIVERSITY LOOKED TAWDRY AND SMALL 

AND YET I FOUND COLONEL INGRAM SITUATED THE SAME AS THE UNLETTERED
MECHANICS  HE WAS NOT A FREE AGENT  HE  TOO  WAS BOUND UPON THE WHEEL 
I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE CHANGE IN HIM WHEN I MENTIONED JACKSONS CASE 
HIS SMILING GOOD NATURE VANISHED LIKE A GHOST  A SUDDEN  FRIGHTFUL
EXPRESSION DISTORTED HIS WELLBRED FACE  I FELT THE SAME ALARM THAT I
HAD FELT WHEN JAMES SMITH BROKE OUT  BUT COLONEL INGRAM DID NOT CURSE 
THAT WAS THE SLIGHT DIFFERENCE THAT WAS LEFT BETWEEN THE WORKINGMAN AND
HIM  HE WAS FAMED AS A WIT  BUT HE HAD NO WIT NOW  AND  UNCONSCIOUSLY 
THIS WAY AND THAT HE GLANCED FOR AVENUES OF ESCAPE  BUT HE WAS TRAPPED
AMID THE PALMS AND RUBBER TREES 

OH  HE WAS SICK OF THE SOUND OF JACKSONS NAME  WHY HAD I BROUGHT THE
MATTER UP HE DID NOT RELISH MY JOKE  IT WAS POOR TASTE ON MY PART 
AND VERY INCONSIDERATE  DID I NOT KNOW THAT IN HIS PROFESSION PERSONAL
FEELINGS DID NOT COUNT HE LEFT HIS PERSONAL FEELINGS AT HOME WHEN
HE WENT DOWN TO THE OFFICE  AT THE OFFICE HE HAD ONLY PROFESSIONAL
FEELINGS 

SHOULD JACKSON HAVE RECEIVED DAMAGES I ASKED 

CERTAINLY  HE ANSWERED  THAT IS  PERSONALLY  I HAVE A FEELING THAT HE
SHOULD  BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LEGAL ASPECTS OF THE CASE 

HE WAS GETTING HIS SCATTERED WITS SLIGHTLY IN HAND 

TELL ME  HAS RIGHT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE LAW I ASKED 

YOU HAVE USED THE WRONG INITIAL CONSONANT  HE SMILED IN ANSWER 

MIGHT I QUERIED AND HE NODDED HIS HEAD  AND YET WE ARE SUPPOSED TO
GET JUSTICE BY MEANS OF THE LAW

THAT IS THE PARADOX OF IT  HE COUNTERED  WE DO GET JUSTICE 

YOU ARE SPEAKING PROFESSIONALLY NOW  ARE YOU NOT I ASKED 

COLONEL INGRAM BLUSHED  ACTUALLY BLUSHED  AND AGAIN HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY
ABOUT HIM FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE  BUT I BLOCKED HIS PATH AND DID NOT OFFER
TO MOVE 

TELL ME  I SAID  WHEN ONE SURRENDERS HIS PERSONAL FEELINGS TO HIS
PROFESSIONAL FEELINGS  MAY NOT THE ACTION BE DEFINED AS A SORT OF
SPIRITUAL MAYHEM

I DID NOT GET AN ANSWER  COLONEL INGRAM HAD INGLORIOUSLY BOLTED 
OVERTURNING A PALM IN HIS FLIGHT 

NEXT I TRIED THE NEWSPAPERS  I WROTE A QUIET  RESTRAINED  DISPASSIONATE
ACCOUNT OF JACKSONS CASE  I MADE NO CHARGES AGAINST THE MEN WITH WHOM
I HAD TALKED  NOR  FOR THAT MATTER  DID I EVEN MENTION THEM  I GAVE
THE ACTUAL FACTS OF THE CASE  THE LONG YEARS JACKSON HAD WORKED IN THE
MILLS  HIS EFFORT TO SAVE THE MACHINERY FROM DAMAGE AND THE CONSEQUENT
ACCIDENT  AND HIS OWN PRESENT WRETCHED AND STARVING CONDITION  THE
THREE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS REJECTED MY COMMUNICATION  LIKEWISE DID THE TWO
WEEKLIES 

I GOT HOLD OF PERCY LAYTON  HE WAS A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY  HAD
GONE IN FOR JOURNALISM  AND WAS THEN SERVING HIS APPRENTICESHIP AS
REPORTER ON THE MOST INFLUENTIAL OF THE THREE NEWSPAPERS  HE SMILED WHEN
I ASKED HIM THE REASON THE NEWSPAPERS SUPPRESSED ALL MENTION OF JACKSON
OR HIS CASE 

EDITORIAL POLICY  HE SAID  WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT  ITS UP
TO THE EDITORS 

BUT WHY IS IT POLICY I ASKED 

WERE ALL SOLID WITH THE CORPORATIONS  HE ANSWERED  IF YOU PAID
ADVERTISING RATES  YOU COULDNT GET ANY SUCH MATTER INTO THE PAPERS  A
MAN WHO TRIED TO SMUGGLE IT IN WOULD LOSE HIS JOB  YOU COULDNT GET IT
IN IF YOU PAID TEN TIMES THE REGULAR ADVERTISING RATES 

HOW ABOUT YOUR OWN POLICY I QUESTIONED  IT WOULD SEEM YOUR FUNCTION
IS TO TWIST TRUTH AT THE COMMAND OF YOUR EMPLOYERS  WHO  IN TURN  OBEY
THE BEHESTS OF THE CORPORATIONS 

I HAVENT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT  HE LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE
MOMENT  THEN BRIGHTENED AS HE SAW HIS WAY OUT  I  MYSELF  DO NOT WRITE
UNTRUTHFUL THINGS  I KEEP SQUARE ALL RIGHT WITH MY OWN CONSCIENCE  OF
COURSE  THERES LOTS THATS REPUGNANT IN THE COURSE OF THE DAYS WORK 
BUT THEN  YOU SEE  THATS ALL PART OF THE DAYS WORK  HE WOUND UP
BOYISHLY 

YET YOU EXPECT TO SIT AT AN EDITORS DESK SOME DAY AND CONDUCT A
POLICY 

ILL BE CASEHARDENED BY THAT TIME  WAS HIS REPLY 

SINCE YOU ARE NOT YET CASEHARDENED  TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK RIGHT NOW
ABOUT THE GENERAL EDITORIAL POLICY 

I DONT THINK  HE ANSWERED QUICKLY  ONE CANT KICK OVER THE ROPES
IF HES GOING TO SUCCEED IN JOURNALISM  IVE LEARNED THAT MUCH  AT ANY
RATE 

AND HE NODDED HIS YOUNG HEAD SAGELY 

BUT THE RIGHT I PERSISTED 

YOU DONT UNDERSTAND THE GAME  OF COURSE ITS ALL RIGHT  BECAUSE IT
COMES OUT ALL RIGHT  DONT YOU SEE

DELIGHTFULLY VAGUE  I MURMURED BUT MY HEART WAS ACHING FOR THE YOUTH
OF HIM  AND I FELT THAT I MUST EITHER SCREAM OR BURST INTO TEARS 

I WAS BEGINNING TO SEE THROUGH THE APPEARANCES OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH I
HAD ALWAYS LIVED  AND TO FIND THE FRIGHTFUL REALITIES THAT WERE BENEATH 
THERE SEEMED A TACIT CONSPIRACY AGAINST JACKSON  AND I WAS AWARE OF A
THRILL OF SYMPATHY FOR THE WHINING LAWYER WHO HAD INGLORIOUSLY FOUGHT
HIS CASE  BUT THIS TACIT CONSPIRACY GREW LARGE  NOT ALONE WAS IT AIMED
AGAINST JACKSON  IT WAS AIMED AGAINST EVERY WORKINGMAN WHO WAS MAIMED IN
THE MILLS  AND IF AGAINST EVERY MAN IN THE MILLS  WHY NOT AGAINST EVERY
MAN IN ALL THE OTHER MILLS AND FACTORIES IN FACT  WAS IT NOT TRUE OF
ALL THE INDUSTRIES

AND IF THIS WAS SO  THEN SOCIETY WAS A LIE  I SHRANK BACK FROM MY OWN
CONCLUSIONS  IT WAS TOO TERRIBLE AND AWFUL TO BE TRUE  BUT THERE WAS
JACKSON  AND JACKSONS ARM  AND THE BLOOD THAT STAINED MY GOWN AND
DRIPPED FROM MY OWN ROOFBEAMS  AND THERE WERE MANY JACKSONSHUNDREDS
OF THEM IN THE MILLS ALONE  AS JACKSON HIMSELF HAD SAID  JACKSON I COULD
NOT ESCAPE 

I SAW MR  WICKSON AND MR  PERTONWAITHE  THE TWO MEN WHO HELD MOST OF THE
STOCK IN THE SIERRA MILLS  BUT I COULD NOT SHAKE THEM AS I HAD SHAKEN
THE MECHANICS IN THEIR EMPLOY  I DISCOVERED THAT THEY HAD AN ETHIC
SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE REST OF SOCIETY  IT WAS WHAT I MAY CALL THE
ARISTOCRATIC ETHIC OR THE MASTER ETHIC  THEY TALKED IN LARGE WAYS OF
POLICY  AND THEY IDENTIFIED POLICY AND RIGHT  AND TO ME THEY TALKED IN
FATHERLY WAYS  PATRONIZING MY YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE  THEY WERE THE MOST
HOPELESS OF ALL I HAD ENCOUNTERED IN MY QUEST  THEY BELIEVED ABSOLUTELY
THAT THEIR CONDUCT WAS RIGHT  THERE WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT  NO
DISCUSSION  THEY WERE CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE THE SAVIOURS OF SOCIETY 
AND THAT IT WAS THEY WHO MADE HAPPINESS FOR THE MANY  AND THEY DREW
PATHETIC PICTURES OF WHAT WOULD BE THE SUFFERINGS OF THE WORKING CLASS
WERE IT NOT FOR THE EMPLOYMENT THAT THEY  AND THEY ALONE  BY THEIR
WISDOM  PROVIDED FOR IT 

      BEFORE AVIS EVERHARD WAS BORN  JOHN STUART MILL  IN HIS
     ESSAY  ON LIBERTY  WROTE  WHEREVER THERE IS AN ASCENDANT
     CLASS  A LARGE PORTION OF THE MORALITY EMANATES FROM ITS
     CLASS INTERESTS AND ITS CLASS FEELINGS OF SUPERIORITY 

FRESH FROM THESE TWO MASTERS  I MET ERNEST AND RELATED MY EXPERIENCE  HE
LOOKED AT ME WITH A PLEASED EXPRESSION  AND SAID 

REALLY  THIS IS FINE  YOU ARE BEGINNING TO DIG TRUTH FOR YOURSELF  IT
IS YOUR OWN EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATION  AND IT IS CORRECT  NO MAN IN THE
INDUSTRIAL MACHINE IS A FREEWILL AGENT  EXCEPT THE LARGE CAPITALIST 
AND HE ISNT  IF YOULL PARDON THE IRISHISM  YOU SEE  THE MASTERS
ARE QUITE SURE THAT THEY ARE RIGHT IN WHAT THEY ARE DOING  THAT IS THE
CROWNING ABSURDITY OF THE WHOLE SITUATION  THEY ARE SO TIED BY THEIR
HUMAN NATURE THAT THEY CANT DO A THING UNLESS THEY THINK IT IS RIGHT 
THEY MUST HAVE A SANCTION FOR THEIR ACTS 

      VERBAL CONTRADICTIONS  CALLED BULLS  WERE LONG AN AMIABLE
     WEAKNESS OF THE ANCIENT IRISH 

WHEN THEY WANT TO DO A THING  IN BUSINESS OF COURSE  THEY MUST WAIT
TILL THERE ARISES IN THEIR BRAINS  SOMEHOW  A RELIGIOUS  OR ETHICAL  OR
SCIENTIFIC  OR PHILOSOPHIC  CONCEPT THAT THE THING IS RIGHT  AND THEN
THEY GO AHEAD AND DO IT  UNWITTING THAT ONE OF THE WEAKNESSES OF THE
HUMAN MIND IS THAT THE WISH IS PARENT TO THE THOUGHT  NO MATTER WHAT
THEY WANT TO DO  THE SANCTION ALWAYS COMES  THEY ARE SUPERFICIAL
CASUISTS  THEY ARE JESUITICAL  THEY EVEN SEE THEIR WAY TO DOING WRONG
THAT RIGHT MAY COME OF IT  ONE OF THE PLEASANT AND AXIOMATIC FICTIONS
THEY HAVE CREATED IS THAT THEY ARE SUPERIOR TO THE REST OF MANKIND IN
WISDOM AND EFFICIENCY  THEREFROM COMES THEIR SANCTION TO MANAGE THE
BREAD AND BUTTER OF THE REST OF MANKIND  THEY HAVE EVEN RESURRECTED THE
THEORY OF THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGSCOMMERCIAL KINGS IN THEIR CASE 

      THE NEWSPAPERS  IN  OF THAT ERA  CREDITED THE
     PRESIDENT OF THE ANTHRACITE COAL TRUST  GEORGE F  BAER  WITH
     THE ENUNCIATION OF THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLE  THE RIGHTS AND
     INTERESTS OF THE LABORING MAN WILL BE PROTECTED BY THE
     CHRISTIAN MEN TO WHOM GOD IN HIS INFINITE WISDOM HAS GIVEN
     THE PROPERTY INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY 

THE WEAKNESS IN THEIR POSITION LIES IN THAT THEY ARE MERELY
BUSINESS MEN  THEY ARE NOT PHILOSOPHERS  THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR
SOCIOLOGISTS  IF THEY WERE  OF COURSE ALL WOULD BE WELL  A BUSINESS MAN
WHO WAS ALSO A BIOLOGIST AND A SOCIOLOGIST WOULD KNOW  APPROXIMATELY 
THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR HUMANITY  BUT  OUTSIDE THE REALM OF BUSINESS 
THESE MEN ARE STUPID  THEY KNOW ONLY BUSINESS  THEY DO NOT KNOW MANKIND
NOR SOCIETY  AND YET THEY SET THEMSELVES UP AS ARBITERS OF THE FATES OF
THE HUNGRY MILLIONS AND ALL THE OTHER MILLIONS THROWN IN  HISTORY  SOME
DAY  WILL HAVE AN EXCRUCIATING LAUGH AT THEIR EXPENSE 

I WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN I HAD MY TALK OUT WITH MRS  WICKSON AND MRS 
PERTONWAITHE  THEY WERE SOCIETY WOMEN  THEIR HOMES WERE PALACES  THEY
HAD MANY HOMES SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY  IN THE MOUNTAINS  ON LAKES 
AND BY THE SEA  THEY WERE TENDED BY ARMIES OF SERVANTS  AND THEIR SOCIAL
ACTIVITIES WERE BEWILDERING  THEY PATRONIZED THE UNIVERSITY AND THE
CHURCHES  AND THE PASTORS ESPECIALLY BOWED AT THEIR KNEES IN MEEK
SUBSERVIENCE  THEY WERE POWERS  THESE TWO WOMEN  WHAT OF THE MONEY
THAT WAS THEIRS  THE POWER OF SUBSIDIZATION OF THOUGHT WAS THEIRS TO A
REMARKABLE DEGREE  AS I WAS SOON TO LEARN UNDER ERNESTS TUITION 

      SOCIETY IS HERE USED IN A RESTRICTED SENSE  A COMMON USAGE
     OF THE TIMES TO DENOTE THE GILDED DRONES THAT DID NO LABOR 
     BUT ONLY GLUTTED THEMSELVES AT THE HONEYVATS OF THE
     WORKERS   NEITHER THE BUSINESS MEN NOR THE LABORERS HAD TIME
     OR OPPORTUNITY FOR SOCIETY  SOCIETY WAS THE CREATION OF THE
     IDLE RICH WHO TOILED NOT AND WHO IN THIS WAY PLAYED 

      BRING ON YOUR TAINTED MONEY  WAS THE EXPRESSED
     SENTIMENT OF THE CHURCH DURING THIS PERIOD 

THEY APED THEIR HUSBANDS  AND TALKED IN THE SAME LARGE WAYS ABOUT
POLICY  AND THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE RICH  THEY WERE
SWAYED BY THE SAME ETHIC THAT DOMINATED THEIR HUSBANDSTHE ETHIC OF
THEIR CLASS AND THEY UTTERED GLIB PHRASES THAT THEIR OWN EARS DID NOT
UNDERSTAND 

ALSO  THEY GREW IRRITATED WHEN I TOLD THEM OF THE DEPLORABLE CONDITION
OF JACKSONS FAMILY  AND WHEN I WONDERED THAT THEY HAD MADE NO
VOLUNTARY PROVISION FOR THE MAN  I WAS TOLD THAT THEY THANKED NO ONE
FOR INSTRUCTING THEM IN THEIR SOCIAL DUTIES  WHEN I ASKED THEM FLATLY
TO ASSIST JACKSON  THEY AS FLATLY REFUSED  THE ASTOUNDING THING ABOUT IT
WAS THAT THEY REFUSED IN ALMOST IDENTICALLY THE SAME LANGUAGE  AND THIS
IN FACE OF THE FACT THAT I INTERVIEWED THEM SEPARATELY AND THAT ONE DID
NOT KNOW THAT I HAD SEEN OR WAS GOING TO SEE THE OTHER  THEIR COMMON
REPLY WAS THAT THEY WERE GLAD OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT PERFECTLY
PLAIN THAT NO PREMIUM WOULD EVER BE PUT ON CARELESSNESS BY THEM NOR
WOULD THEY  BY PAYING FOR ACCIDENT  TEMPT THE POOR TO HURT THEMSELVES IN
THE MACHINERY 

      IN THE FILES OF THE OUTLOOK  A CRITICAL WEEKLY OF THE
     PERIOD  IN THE NUMBER DATED AUGUST     IS RELATED THE
     CIRCUMSTANCE OF A WORKINGMAN LOSING HIS ARM  THE DETAILS OF
     WHICH ARE QUITE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF JACKSONS CASE AS
     RELATED BY AVIS EVERHARD 

AND THEY WERE SINCERE  THESE TWO WOMEN  THEY WERE DRUNK WITH CONVICTION
OF THE SUPERIORITY OF THEIR CLASS AND OF THEMSELVES  THEY HAD A
SANCTION  IN THEIR OWN CLASSETHIC  FOR EVERY ACT THEY PERFORMED  AS I
DROVE AWAY FROM MRS  PERTONWAITHES GREAT HOUSE  I LOOKED BACK AT
IT  AND I REMEMBERED ERNESTS EXPRESSION THAT THEY WERE BOUND TO THE
MACHINE  BUT THAT THEY WERE SO BOUND THAT THEY SAT ON TOP OF IT 



CHAPTER V

THE PHILOMATHS


ERNEST WAS OFTEN AT THE HOUSE  NOR WAS IT MY FATHER  MERELY  NOR
THE CONTROVERSIAL DINNERS  THAT DREW HIM THERE  EVEN AT THAT TIME I
FLATTERED MYSELF THAT I PLAYED SOME PART IN CAUSING HIS VISITS  AND IT
WAS NOT LONG BEFORE I LEARNED THE CORRECTNESS OF MY SURMISE  FOR NEVER
WAS THERE SUCH A LOVER AS ERNEST EVERHARD  HIS GAZE AND HIS HANDCLASP
GREW FIRMER AND STEADIER  IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE AND THE QUESTION THAT
HAD GROWN FROM THE FIRST IN HIS EYES  GREW ONLY THE MORE IMPERATIVE 

MY IMPRESSION OF HIM  THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM  HAD BEEN UNFAVORABLE 
THEN I HAD FOUND MYSELF ATTRACTED TOWARD HIM  NEXT CAME MY REPULSION 
WHEN HE SO SAVAGELY ATTACKED MY CLASS AND ME  AFTER THAT  AS I SAW THAT
HE HAD NOT MALIGNED MY CLASS  AND THAT THE HARSH AND BITTER THINGS HE
SAID ABOUT IT WERE JUSTIFIED  I HAD DRAWN CLOSER TO HIM AGAIN  HE BECAME
MY ORACLE  FOR ME HE TORE THE SHAM FROM THE FACE OF SOCIETY AND GAVE
ME GLIMPSES OF REALITY THAT WERE AS UNPLEASANT AS THEY WERE UNDENIABLY
TRUE 

AS I HAVE SAID  THERE WAS NEVER SUCH A LOVER AS HE  NO GIRL COULD
LIVE IN A UNIVERSITY TOWN TILL SHE WAS TWENTYFOUR AND NOT HAVE LOVE
EXPERIENCES  I HAD BEEN MADE LOVE TO BY BEARDLESS SOPHOMORES AND GRAY
PROFESSORS  AND BY THE ATHLETES AND THE FOOTBALL GIANTS  BUT NOT ONE
OF THEM MADE LOVE TO ME AS ERNEST DID  HIS ARMS WERE AROUND ME BEFORE I
KNEW  HIS LIPS WERE ON MINE BEFORE I COULD PROTEST OR RESIST  BEFORE HIS
EARNESTNESS CONVENTIONAL MAIDEN DIGNITY WAS RIDICULOUS  HE SWEPT ME OFF
MY FEET BY THE SPLENDID INVINCIBLE RUSH OF HIM  HE DID NOT PROPOSE  HE
PUT HIS ARMS AROUND ME AND KISSED ME AND TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT
WE SHOULD BE MARRIED  THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION ABOUT IT  THE ONLY
DISCUSSIONAND THAT AROSE AFTERWARDWAS WHEN WE SHOULD BE MARRIED 

IT WAS UNPRECEDENTED  IT WAS UNREAL  YET  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNESTS
TEST OF TRUTH  IT WORKED  I TRUSTED MY LIFE TO IT  AND FORTUNATE WAS THE
TRUST  YET DURING THOSE FIRST DAYS OF OUR LOVE  FEAR OF THE FUTURE
CAME OFTEN TO ME WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE VIOLENCE AND IMPETUOSITY OF HIS
LOVEMAKING  YET SUCH FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS  NO WOMAN WAS EVER BLESSED
WITH A GENTLER  TENDERER HUSBAND  THIS GENTLENESS AND VIOLENCE ON
HIS PART WAS A CURIOUS BLEND SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN HIS CARRIAGE OF
AWKWARDNESS AND EASE  THAT SLIGHT AWKWARDNESS HE NEVER GOT OVER IT 
AND IT WAS DELICIOUS  HIS BEHAVIOR IN OUR DRAWINGROOM REMINDED ME OF A
CAREFUL BULL IN A CHINA SHOP 

      IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS STILL THE CUSTOM TO FILL THE LIVING
     ROOMS WITH BRICABRAC   THEY HAD NOT DISCOVERED SIMPLICITY
     OF LIVING  SUCH ROOMS WERE MUSEUMS  ENTAILING ENDLESS LABOR
     TO KEEP CLEAN  THE DUSTDEMON WAS THE LORD OF THE HOUSEHOLD 
     THERE WERE A MYRIAD DEVICES FOR CATCHING DUST  AND ONLY A
     FEW DEVICES FOR GETTING RID OF IT 

IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT VANISHED MY LAST DOUBT OF THE COMPLETENESS OF
MY LOVE FOR HIM A SUBCONSCIOUS DOUBT  AT MOST  IT WAS AT THE PHILOMATH
CLUBA WONDERFUL NIGHT OF BATTLE  WHEREIN ERNEST BEARDED THE MASTERS
IN THEIR LAIR  NOW THE PHILOMATH CLUB WAS THE MOST SELECT ON THE PACIFIC
COAST  IT WAS THE CREATION OF MISS BRENTWOOD  AN ENORMOUSLY WEALTHY OLD
MAID AND IT WAS HER HUSBAND  AND FAMILY  AND TOY  ITS MEMBERS WERE THE
WEALTHIEST IN THE COMMUNITY  AND THE STRONGESTMINDED OF THE WEALTHY 
WITH  OF COURSE  A SPRINKLING OF SCHOLARS TO GIVE IT INTELLECTUAL TONE 

THE PHILOMATH HAD NO CLUB HOUSE  IT WAS NOT THAT KIND OF A CLUB  ONCE A
MONTH ITS MEMBERS GATHERED AT SOME ONE OF THEIR PRIVATE HOUSES TO LISTEN
TO A LECTURE  THE LECTURERS WERE USUALLY  THOUGH NOT ALWAYS  HIRED  IF A
CHEMIST IN NEW YORK MADE A NEW DISCOVERY IN SAY RADIUM  ALL HIS EXPENSES
ACROSS THE CONTINENT WERE PAID  AND AS WELL HE RECEIVED A PRINCELY FEE
FOR HIS TIME  THE SAME WITH A RETURNING EXPLORER FROM THE POLAR REGIONS 
OR THE LATEST LITERARY OR ARTISTIC SUCCESS  NO VISITORS WERE ALLOWED 
WHILE IT WAS THE PHILOMATHS POLICY TO PERMIT NONE OF ITS DISCUSSIONS
TO GET INTO THE PAPERS  THUS GREAT STATESMENAND THERE HAD BEEN SUCH
OCCASIONSWERE ABLE FULLY TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS 

I SPREAD BEFORE ME A WRINKLED LETTER  WRITTEN TO ME BY ERNEST TWENTY
YEARS AGO  AND FROM IT I COPY THE FOLLOWING 

YOUR FATHER IS A MEMBER OF THE PHILOMATH  SO YOU ARE ABLE TO COME 
THEREFORE COME NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT  I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE
TIME OF YOUR LIFE  IN YOUR RECENT ENCOUNTERS  YOU FAILED TO SHAKE THE
MASTERS  IF YOU COME  ILL SHAKE THEM FOR YOU  ILL MAKE THEM SNARL LIKE
WOLVES  YOU MERELY QUESTIONED THEIR MORALITY  WHEN THEIR MORALITY IS
QUESTIONED  THEY GROW ONLY THE MORE COMPLACENT AND SUPERIOR  BUT I SHALL
MENACE THEIR MONEYBAGS  THAT WILL SHAKE THEM TO THE ROOTS OF THEIR
PRIMITIVE NATURES  IF YOU CAN COME  YOU WILL SEE THE CAVEMAN  IN
EVENING DRESS  SNARLING AND SNAPPING OVER A BONE  I PROMISE YOU A GREAT
CATERWAULING AND AN ILLUMINATING INSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF THE BEAST 

THEYVE INVITED ME IN ORDER TO TEAR ME TO PIECES  THIS IS THE IDEA OF
MISS BRENTWOOD  SHE CLUMSILY HINTED AS MUCH WHEN SHE INVITED ME 
SHES GIVEN THEM THAT KIND OF FUN BEFORE  THEY DELIGHT IN GETTING
TRUSTFULSOULED GENTLE REFORMERS BEFORE THEM  MISS BRENTWOOD THINKS I
AM AS MILD AS A KITTEN AND AS GOODNATURED AND STOLID AS THE FAMILY COW 
ILL NOT DENY THAT I HELPED TO GIVE HER THAT IMPRESSION  SHE WAS VERY
TENTATIVE AT FIRST  UNTIL SHE DIVINED MY HARMLESSNESS  I AM TO RECEIVE
A HANDSOME FEETWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARSAS BEFITS THE MAN WHO 
THOUGH A RADICAL  ONCE RAN FOR GOVERNOR  ALSO  I AM TO WEAR EVENING
DRESS  THIS IS COMPULSORY  I NEVER WAS SO APPARELLED IN MY LIFE  I
SUPPOSE ILL HAVE TO HIRE ONE SOMEWHERE  BUT ID DO MORE THAN THAT TO
GET A CHANCE AT THE PHILOMATHS 

OF ALL PLACES  THE CLUB GATHERED THAT NIGHT AT THE PERTONWAITHE HOUSE 
EXTRA CHAIRS HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE GREAT DRAWINGROOM  AND IN
ALL THERE MUST HAVE BEEN TWO HUNDRED PHILOMATHS THAT SAT DOWN TO HEAR
ERNEST  THEY WERE TRULY LORDS OF SOCIETY  I AMUSED MYSELF WITH RUNNING
OVER IN MY MIND THE SUM OF THE FORTUNES REPRESENTED  AND IT RAN WELL
INTO THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS  AND THE POSSESSORS WERE NOT OF THE IDLE
RICH  THEY WERE MEN OF AFFAIRS WHO TOOK MOST ACTIVE PARTS IN INDUSTRIAL
AND POLITICAL LIFE 

WE WERE ALL SEATED WHEN MISS BRENTWOOD BROUGHT ERNEST IN  THEY MOVED
AT ONCE TO THE HEAD OF THE ROOM  FROM WHERE HE WAS TO SPEAK  HE WAS
IN EVENING DRESS  AND  WHAT OF HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND KINGLY HEAD  HE
LOOKED MAGNIFICENT  AND THEN THERE WAS THAT FAINT AND UNMISTAKABLE TOUCH
OF AWKWARDNESS IN HIS MOVEMENTS  I ALMOST THINK I COULD HAVE LOVED HIM
FOR THAT ALONE  AND AS I LOOKED AT HIM I WAS AWARE OF A GREAT JOY  I
FELT AGAIN THE PULSE OF HIS PALM ON MINE  THE TOUCH OF HIS LIPS AND
SUCH PRIDE WAS MINE THAT I FELT I MUST RISE UP AND CRY OUT TO THE
ASSEMBLED COMPANY  HE IS MINE HE HAS HELD ME IN HIS ARMS  AND I 
MERE I  HAVE FILLED THAT MIND OF HIS TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL HIS
MULTITUDINOUS AND KINGLY THOUGHTS

AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM  MISS BRENTWOOD INTRODUCED HIM TO COLONEL VAN
GILBERT  AND I KNEW THAT THE LATTER WAS TO PRESIDE  COLONEL VAN GILBERT
WAS A GREAT CORPORATION LAWYER  IN ADDITION  HE WAS IMMENSELY WEALTHY 
THE SMALLEST FEE HE WOULD DEIGN TO NOTICE WAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS  HE WAS A MASTER OF LAW  THE LAW WAS A PUPPET WITH WHICH HE
PLAYED  HE MOULDED IT LIKE CLAY  TWISTED AND DISTORTED IT LIKE A CHINESE
PUZZLE INTO ANY DESIGN HE CHOSE  IN APPEARANCE AND RHETORIC HE WAS
OLDFASHIONED  BUT IN IMAGINATION AND KNOWLEDGE AND RESOURCE HE WAS AS
YOUNG AS THE LATEST STATUTE  HIS FIRST PROMINENCE HAD COME WHEN HE BROKE
THE SHARDWELL WILL  HIS FEE FOR THIS ONE ACT WAS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS  FROM THEN ON HE HAD RISEN LIKE A ROCKET  HE WAS OFTEN CALLED
THE GREATEST LAWYER IN THE COUNTRYCORPORATION LAWYER  OF COURSE AND
NO CLASSIFICATION OF THE THREE GREATEST LAWYERS IN THE UNITED STATES
COULD HAVE EXCLUDED HIM 

      THIS BREAKING OF WILLS WAS A PECULIAR FEATURE OF THE
     PERIOD  WITH THE ACCUMULATION OF VAST FORTUNES  THE PROBLEM
     OF DISPOSING OF THESE FORTUNES AFTER DEATH WAS A VEXING ONE
     TO THE ACCUMULATORS  WILLMAKING AND WILLBREAKING BECAME
     COMPLEMENTARY TRADES  LIKE ARMORMAKING AND GUNMAKING   THE
     SHREWDEST WILLMAKING LAWYERS WERE CALLED IN TO MAKE WILLS
     THAT COULD NOT BE BROKEN   BUT THESE WILLS WERE ALWAYS
     BROKEN  AND VERY OFTEN BY THE VERY LAWYERS THAT HAD DRAWN
     THEM UP   NEVERTHELESS THE DELUSION PERSISTED IN THE WEALTHY
     CLASS THAT AN ABSOLUTELY UNBREAKABLE WILL COULD BE CAST AND
     SO  THROUGH THE GENERATIONS  CLIENTS AND LAWYERS PURSUED THE
     ILLUSION   IT WAS A PURSUIT LIKE UNTO THAT OF THE UNIVERSAL
     SOLVENT OF THE MEDIAEVAL ALCHEMISTS 

HE AROSE AND BEGAN  IN A FEW WELLCHOSEN PHRASES THAT CARRIED AN
UNDERTONE OF FAINT IRONY  TO INTRODUCE ERNEST  COLONEL VAN GILBERT WAS
SUBTLY FACETIOUS IN HIS INTRODUCTION OF THE SOCIAL REFORMER AND MEMBER
OF THE WORKING CLASS  AND THE AUDIENCE SMILED  IT MADE ME ANGRY  AND
I GLANCED AT ERNEST  THE SIGHT OF HIM MADE ME DOUBLY ANGRY  HE DID NOT
SEEM TO RESENT THE DELICATE SLURS  WORSE THAN THAT  HE DID NOT SEEM TO
BE AWARE OF THEM  THERE HE SAT  GENTLE  AND STOLID  AND SOMNOLENT  HE
REALLY LOOKED STUPID  AND FOR A MOMENT THE THOUGHT ROSE IN MY MIND  WHAT
IF HE WERE OVERAWED BY THIS IMPOSING ARRAY OF POWER AND BRAINS THEN I
SMILED  HE COULDNT FOOL ME  BUT HE FOOLED THE OTHERS  JUST AS HE HAD
FOOLED MISS BRENTWOOD  SHE OCCUPIED A CHAIR RIGHT UP TO THE FRONT  AND
SEVERAL TIMES SHE TURNED HER HEAD TOWARD ONE OR ANOTHER OF HER CONFRERES
AND SMILED HER APPRECIATION OF THE REMARKS 

COLONEL VAN GILBERT DONE  ERNEST AROSE AND BEGAN TO SPEAK  HE BEGAN IN
A LOW VOICE  HALTINGLY AND MODESTLY  AND WITH AN AIR OF EVIDENT
EMBARRASSMENT  HE SPOKE OF HIS BIRTH IN THE WORKING CLASS  AND OF THE
SORDIDNESS AND WRETCHEDNESS OF HIS ENVIRONMENT  WHERE FLESH AND SPIRIT
WERE ALIKE STARVED AND TORMENTED  HE DESCRIBED HIS AMBITIONS AND IDEALS 
AND HIS CONCEPTION OF THE PARADISE WHEREIN LIVED THE PEOPLE OF THE UPPER
CLASSES  AS HE SAID 

UP ABOVE ME  I KNEW  WERE UNSELFISHNESSES OF THE SPIRIT  CLEAN AND
NOBLE THINKING  KEEN INTELLECTUAL LIVING  I KNEW ALL THIS BECAUSE I READ
SEASIDE LIBRARY NOVELS  IN WHICH  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE VILLAINS
AND ADVENTURESSES  ALL MEN AND WOMEN THOUGHT BEAUTIFUL THOUGHTS  SPOKE A
BEAUTIFUL TONGUE  AND PERFORMED GLORIOUS DEEDS  IN SHORT  AS I ACCEPTED
THE RISING OF THE SUN  I ACCEPTED THAT UP ABOVE ME WAS ALL THAT WAS FINE
AND NOBLE AND GRACIOUS  ALL THAT GAVE DECENCY AND DIGNITY TO LIFE  ALL
THAT MADE LIFE WORTH LIVING AND THAT REMUNERATED ONE FOR HIS TRAVAIL AND
MISERY 

      A CURIOUS AND AMAZING LITERATURE THAT SERVED TO MAKE THE
     WORKING CLASS UTTERLY MISAPPREHEND THE NATURE OF THE LEISURE
     CLASS 

HE WENT ON AND TRACED HIS LIFE IN THE MILLS  THE LEARNING OF THE
HORSESHOEING TRADE  AND HIS MEETING WITH THE SOCIALISTS  AMONG THEM  HE
SAID  HE HAD FOUND KEEN INTELLECTS AND BRILLIANT WITS  MINISTERS OF THE
GOSPEL WHO HAD BEEN BROKEN BECAUSE THEIR CHRISTIANITY WAS TOO WIDE FOR
ANY CONGREGATION OF MAMMONWORSHIPPERS  AND PROFESSORS WHO HAD BEEN
BROKEN ON THE WHEEL OF UNIVERSITY SUBSERVIENCE TO THE RULING CLASS  THE
SOCIALISTS WERE REVOLUTIONISTS  HE SAID  STRUGGLING TO OVERTHROW THE
IRRATIONAL SOCIETY OF THE PRESENT AND OUT OF THE MATERIAL TO BUILD THE
RATIONAL SOCIETY OF THE FUTURE  MUCH MORE HE SAID THAT WOULD TAKE TOO
LONG TO WRITE  BUT I SHALL NEVER FORGET HOW HE DESCRIBED THE LIFE AMONG
THE REVOLUTIONISTS  ALL HALTING UTTERANCE VANISHED  HIS VOICE GREW
STRONG AND CONFIDENT  AND IT GLOWED AS HE GLOWED  AND AS THE THOUGHTS
GLOWED THAT POURED OUT FROM HIM  HE SAID 

AMONGST THE REVOLUTIONISTS I FOUND  ALSO  WARM FAITH IN THE HUMAN 
ARDENT IDEALISM  SWEETNESSES OF UNSELFISHNESS  RENUNCIATION  AND
MARTYRDOMALL THE SPLENDID  STINGING THINGS OF THE SPIRIT  HERE LIFE
WAS CLEAN  NOBLE  AND ALIVE  I WAS IN TOUCH WITH GREAT SOULS WHO EXALTED
FLESH AND SPIRIT OVER DOLLARS AND CENTS  AND TO WHOM THE THIN WAIL OF
THE STARVED SLUM CHILD MEANT MORE THAN ALL THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF
COMMERCIAL EXPANSION AND WORLD EMPIRE  ALL ABOUT ME WERE NOBLENESS OF
PURPOSE AND HEROISM OF EFFORT  AND MY DAYS AND NIGHTS WERE SUNSHINE
AND STARSHINE  ALL FIRE AND DEW  WITH BEFORE MY EYES  EVER BURNING
AND BLAZING  THE HOLY GRAIL  CHRISTS OWN GRAIL  THE WARM HUMAN 
LONGSUFFERING AND MALTREATED BUT TO BE RESCUED AND SAVED AT THE LAST 

AS BEFORE I HAD SEEN HIM TRANSFIGURED  SO NOW HE STOOD TRANSFIGURED
BEFORE ME  HIS BROWS WERE BRIGHT WITH THE DIVINE THAT WAS IN HIM  AND
BRIGHTER YET SHONE HIS EYES FROM THE MIDST OF THE RADIANCE THAT SEEMED
TO ENVELOP HIM AS A MANTLE  BUT THE OTHERS DID NOT SEE THIS RADIANCE 
AND I ASSUMED THAT IT WAS DUE TO THE TEARS OF JOY AND LOVE THAT DIMMED
MY VISION  AT ANY RATE  MR  WICKSON  WHO SAT BEHIND ME  WAS UNAFFECTED 
FOR I HEARD HIM SNEER ALOUD  UTOPIAN 

      THE PEOPLE OF THAT AGE WERE PHRASE SLAVES   THE ABJECTNESS
     OF THEIR SERVITUDE IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US   THERE WAS A
     MAGIC IN WORDS GREATER THAN THE CONJURERS ART   SO
     BEFUDDLED AND CHAOTIC WERE THEIR MINDS THAT THE UTTERANCE OF
     A SINGLE WORD COULD NEGATIVE THE GENERALIZATIONS OF A
     LIFETIME OF SERIOUS RESEARCH AND THOUGHT  SUCH A WORD WAS
     THE ADJECTIVE UTOPIAN   THE MERE UTTERANCE OF IT COULD DAMN
     ANY SCHEME  NO MATTER HOW SANELY CONCEIVED  OF ECONOMIC
     AMELIORATION OR REGENERATION   VAST POPULATIONS GREW
     FRENZIED OVER SUCH PHRASES AS AN HONEST DOLLAR AND A FULL
     DINNER PAIL   THE COINAGE OF SUCH PHRASES WAS CONSIDERED
     STROKES OF GENIUS 

ERNEST WENT ON TO HIS RISE IN SOCIETY  TILL AT LAST HE CAME IN TOUCH
WITH MEMBERS OF THE UPPER CLASSES  AND RUBBED SHOULDERS WITH THE MEN
WHO SAT IN THE HIGH PLACES  THEN CAME HIS DISILLUSIONMENT  AND THIS
DISILLUSIONMENT HE DESCRIBED IN TERMS THAT DID NOT FLATTER HIS AUDIENCE 
HE WAS SURPRISED AT THE COMMONNESS OF THE CLAY  LIFE PROVED NOT TO BE
FINE AND GRACIOUS  HE WAS APPALLED BY THE SELFISHNESS HE ENCOUNTERED 
AND WHAT HAD SURPRISED HIM EVEN MORE THAN THAT WAS THE ABSENCE OF
INTELLECTUAL LIFE  FRESH FROM HIS REVOLUTIONISTS  HE WAS SHOCKED BY THE
INTELLECTUAL STUPIDITY OF THE MASTER CLASS  AND THEN  IN SPITE OF THEIR
MAGNIFICENT CHURCHES AND WELLPAID PREACHERS  HE HAD FOUND THE MASTERS 
MEN AND WOMEN  GROSSLY MATERIAL  IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY PRATTLED SWEET
LITTLE IDEALS AND DEAR LITTLE MORALITIES  BUT IN SPITE OF THEIR PRATTLE
THE DOMINANT KEY OF THE LIFE THEY LIVED WAS MATERIALISTIC  AND THEY WERE
WITHOUT REAL MORALITYFOR INSTANCE  THAT WHICH CHRIST HAD PREACHED BUT
WHICH WAS NO LONGER PREACHED 

I MET MEN  HE SAID  WHO INVOKED THE NAME OF THE PRINCE OF PEACE
IN THEIR DIATRIBES AGAINST WAR  AND WHO PUT RIFLES IN THE HANDS OF
PINKERTONS WITH WHICH TO SHOOT DOWN STRIKERS IN THEIR OWN FACTORIES  I
MET MEN INCOHERENT WITH INDIGNATION AT THE BRUTALITY OF PRIZEFIGHTING 
AND WHO  AT THE SAME TIME  WERE PARTIES TO THE ADULTERATION OF FOOD THAT
KILLED EACH YEAR MORE BABES THAN EVEN REDHANDED HEROD HAD KILLED 

      ORIGINALLY  THEY WERE PRIVATE DETECTIVES BUT THEY QUICKLY
     BECAME HIRED FIGHTING MEN OF THE CAPITALISTS  AND ULTIMATELY
     DEVELOPED INTO THE MERCENARIES OF THE OLIGARCHY 

THIS DELICATE  ARISTOCRATICFEATURED GENTLEMAN WAS A DUMMY DIRECTOR
AND A TOOL OF CORPORATIONS THAT SECRETLY ROBBED WIDOWS AND ORPHANS  THIS
GENTLEMAN  WHO COLLECTED FINE EDITIONS AND WAS A PATRON OF LITERATURE 
PAID BLACKMAIL TO A HEAVYJOWLED  BLACKBROWED BOSS OF A MUNICIPAL
MACHINE  THIS EDITOR  WHO PUBLISHED PATENT MEDICINE ADVERTISEMENTS 
CALLED ME A SCOUNDRELLY DEMAGOGUE BECAUSE I DARED HIM TO PRINT IN HIS
PAPER THE TRUTH ABOUT PATENT MEDICINES  THIS MAN  TALKING SOBERLY AND
EARNESTLY ABOUT THE BEAUTIES OF IDEALISM AND THE GOODNESS OF GOD  HAD
JUST BETRAYED HIS COMRADES IN A BUSINESS DEAL  THIS MAN  A PILLAR OF THE
CHURCH AND HEAVY CONTRIBUTOR TO FOREIGN MISSIONS  WORKED HIS SHOP GIRLS
TEN HOURS A DAY ON A STARVATION WAGE AND THEREBY DIRECTLY ENCOURAGED
PROSTITUTION  THIS MAN  WHO ENDOWED CHAIRS IN UNIVERSITIES AND ERECTED
MAGNIFICENT CHAPELS  PERJURED HIMSELF IN COURTS OF LAW OVER DOLLARS
AND CENTS  THIS RAILROAD MAGNATE BROKE HIS WORD AS A CITIZEN  AS A
GENTLEMAN  AND AS A CHRISTIAN  WHEN HE GRANTED A SECRET REBATE  AND HE
GRANTED MANY SECRET REBATES  THIS SENATOR WAS THE TOOL AND THE SLAVE 
THE LITTLE PUPPET  OF A BRUTAL UNEDUCATED MACHINE BOSS SO WAS THIS
GOVERNOR AND THIS SUPREME COURT JUDGE AND ALL THREE RODE ON RAILROAD
PASSES AND  ALSO  THIS SLEEK CAPITALIST OWNED THE MACHINE  THE MACHINE
BOSS  AND THE RAILROADS THAT ISSUED THE PASSES 

      PATENT MEDICINES WERE PATENT LIES  BUT  LIKE THE CHARMS
     AND INDULGENCES OF THE MIDDLE AGES  THEY DECEIVED THE
     PEOPLE   THE ONLY DIFFERENCE LAY IN THAT THE PATENT
     MEDICINES WERE MORE HARMFUL AND MORE COSTLY 

      EVEN AS LATE AS   A D   THE GREAT MASS OF THE PEOPLE
     STILL PERSISTED IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY RULED THE COUNTRY BY
     VIRTUE OF THEIR BALLOTS   IN REALITY  THE COUNTRY WAS RULED
     BY WHAT WERE CALLED POLITICAL MACHINES   AT FIRST THE
     MACHINE BOSSES CHARGED THE MASTER CAPITALISTS EXTORTIONATE
     TOLLS FOR LEGISLATION BUT IN A SHORT TIME THE MASTER
     CAPITALISTS FOUND IT CHEAPER TO OWN THE POLITICAL MACHINES
     THEMSELVES AND TO HIRE THE MACHINE BOSSES 

AND SO IT WAS  INSTEAD OF IN PARADISE  THAT I FOUND MYSELF IN THE
ARID DESERT OF COMMERCIALISM  I FOUND NOTHING BUT STUPIDITY  EXCEPT FOR
BUSINESS  I FOUND NONE CLEAN  NOBLE  AND ALIVE  THOUGH I FOUND MANY WHO
WERE ALIVEWITH ROTTENNESS  WHAT I DID FIND WAS MONSTROUS SELFISHNESS
AND HEARTLESSNESS  AND A GROSS  GLUTTONOUS  PRACTISED  AND PRACTICAL
MATERIALISM 

MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT 
INTELLECTUALLY THEY HAD BORED HIM MORALLY AND SPIRITUALLY THEY HAD
SICKENED HIM SO THAT HE WAS GLAD TO GO BACK TO HIS REVOLUTIONISTS  WHO
WERE CLEAN  NOBLE  AND ALIVE  AND ALL THAT THE CAPITALISTS WERE NOT 

AND NOW  HE SAID  LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THAT REVOLUTION 

BUT FIRST I MUST SAY THAT HIS TERRIBLE DIATRIBE HAD NOT TOUCHED THEM  I
LOOKED ABOUT ME AT THEIR FACES AND SAW THAT THEY REMAINED COMPLACENTLY
SUPERIOR TO WHAT HE HAD CHARGED  AND I REMEMBERED WHAT HE HAD TOLD ME 
THAT NO INDICTMENT OF THEIR MORALITY COULD SHAKE THEM  HOWEVER  I COULD
SEE THAT THE BOLDNESS OF HIS LANGUAGE HAD AFFECTED MISS BRENTWOOD  SHE
WAS LOOKING WORRIED AND APPREHENSIVE 

ERNEST BEGAN BY DESCRIBING THE ARMY OF REVOLUTION  AND AS HE GAVE THE
FIGURES OF ITS STRENGTH THE VOTES CAST IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES  THE
ASSEMBLAGE BEGAN TO GROW RESTLESS  CONCERN SHOWED IN THEIR FACES  AND I
NOTICED A TIGHTENING OF LIPS  AT LAST THE GAGE OF BATTLE HAD BEEN THROWN
DOWN  HE DESCRIBED THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE SOCIALISTS THAT
UNITED THE MILLION AND A HALF IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THE TWENTYTHREE
MILLIONS AND A HALF IN THE REST OF THE WORLD 

SUCH AN ARMY OF REVOLUTION  HE SAID  TWENTYFIVE MILLIONS STRONG  IS
A THING TO MAKE RULERS AND RULING CLASSES PAUSE AND CONSIDER  THE CRY
OF THIS ARMY IS  NO QUARTER WE WANT ALL THAT YOU POSSESS  WE WILL
BE CONTENT WITH NOTHING LESS THAN ALL THAT YOU POSSESS  WE WANT IN OUR
HANDS THE REINS OF POWER AND THE DESTINY OF MANKIND  HERE ARE OUR HANDS 
THEY ARE STRONG HANDS  WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR GOVERNMENTS  YOUR
PALACES  AND ALL YOUR PURPLED EASE AWAY FROM YOU  AND IN THAT DAY
YOU SHALL WORK FOR YOUR BREAD EVEN AS THE PEASANT IN THE FIELD OR THE
STARVED AND RUNTY CLERK IN YOUR METROPOLISES  HERE ARE OUR HANDS  THEY
ARE STRONG HANDS

AND AS HE SPOKE HE EXTENDED FROM HIS SPLENDID SHOULDERS HIS TWO GREAT
ARMS  AND THE HORSESHOERS HANDS WERE CLUTCHING THE AIR LIKE EAGLES
TALONS  HE WAS THE SPIRIT OF REGNANT LABOR AS HE STOOD THERE  HIS HANDS
OUTREACHING TO REND AND CRUSH HIS AUDIENCE  I WAS AWARE OF A FAINTLY
PERCEPTIBLE SHRINKING ON THE PART OF THE LISTENERS BEFORE THIS FIGURE
OF REVOLUTION  CONCRETE  POTENTIAL  AND MENACING  THAT IS  THE WOMEN
SHRANK  AND FEAR WAS IN THEIR FACES  NOT SO WITH THE MEN  THEY WERE
OF THE ACTIVE RICH  AND NOT THE IDLE  AND THEY WERE FIGHTERS  A LOW 
THROATY RUMBLE AROSE  LINGERED ON THE AIR A MOMENT  AND CEASED  IT
WAS THE FORERUNNER OF THE SNARL  AND I WAS TO HEAR IT MANY TIMES THAT
NIGHTTHE TOKEN OF THE BRUTE IN MAN  THE EARNEST OF HIS PRIMITIVE
PASSIONS  AND THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUS THAT THEY HAD MADE THIS SOUND 
IT WAS THE GROWL OF THE PACK  MOUTHED BY THE PACK  AND MOUTHED IN ALL
UNCONSCIOUSNESS  AND IN THAT MOMENT  AS I SAW THE HARSHNESS FORM IN
THEIR FACES AND SAW THE FIGHTLIGHT FLASHING IN THEIR EYES  I REALIZED
THAT NOT EASILY WOULD THEY LET THEIR LORDSHIP OF THE WORLD BE WRESTED
FROM THEM 

ERNEST PROCEEDED WITH HIS ATTACK  HE ACCOUNTED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE
MILLION AND A HALF OF REVOLUTIONISTS IN THE UNITED STATES BY CHARGING
THE CAPITALIST CLASS WITH HAVING MISMANAGED SOCIETY  HE SKETCHED THE
ECONOMIC CONDITION OF THE CAVEMAN AND OF THE SAVAGE PEOPLES OF TODAY 
POINTING OUT THAT THEY POSSESSED NEITHER TOOLS NOR MACHINES  AND
POSSESSED ONLY A NATURAL EFFICIENCY OF ONE IN PRODUCING POWER  THEN
HE TRACED THE DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINERY AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION SO THAT
TODAY THE PRODUCING POWER OF CIVILIZED MAN WAS A THOUSAND TIMES GREATER
THAN THAT OF THE SAVAGE 

FIVE MEN  HE SAID  CAN PRODUCE BREAD FOR A THOUSAND  ONE MAN CAN
PRODUCE COTTON CLOTH FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE  WOOLLENS FOR
THREE HUNDRED  AND BOOTS AND SHOES FOR A THOUSAND  ONE WOULD CONCLUDE
FROM THIS THAT UNDER A CAPABLE MANAGEMENT OF SOCIETY MODERN CIVILIZED
MAN WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER OFF THAN THE CAVEMAN  BUT IS HE LET
US SEE  IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY THERE ARE FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE
LIVING IN POVERTY AND BY POVERTY IS MEANT THAT CONDITION IN LIFE IN
WHICH  THROUGH LACK OF FOOD AND ADEQUATE SHELTER  THE MERE STANDARD OF
WORKING EFFICIENCY CANNOT BE MAINTAINED  IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY  IN
SPITE OF ALL YOUR SOCALLED LABOR LEGISLATION  THERE ARE THREE MILLIONS
OF CHILD LABORERS  IN TWELVE YEARS THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN DOUBLED 
AND IN PASSING I WILL ASK YOU MANAGERS OF SOCIETY WHY YOU DID NOT MAKE
PUBLIC THE CENSUS FIGURES OF  AND I WILL ANSWER FOR YOU  THAT
YOU WERE AFRAID  THE FIGURES OF MISERY WOULD HAVE PRECIPITATED THE
REVOLUTION THAT EVEN NOW IS GATHERING 

      ROBERT HUNTER  IN   IN A BOOK ENTITLED POVERTY 
     POINTED OUT THAT AT THAT TIME THERE WERE TEN MILLIONS IN THE
     UNITED STATES LIVING IN POVERTY 

      IN THE UNITED STATES CENSUS OF  THE LAST CENSUS THE
     FIGURES OF WHICH WERE MADE PUBLIC  THE NUMBER OF CHILD
     LABORERS WAS PLACED AT    

BUT TO RETURN TO MY INDICTMENT  IF MODERN MANS PRODUCING POWER IS
A THOUSAND TIMES GREATER THAN THAT OF THE CAVEMAN  WHY THEN  IN THE
UNITED STATES TODAY  ARE THERE FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT
PROPERLY SHELTERED AND PROPERLY FED WHY THEN  IN THE UNITED STATES
TODAY  ARE THERE THREE MILLION CHILD LABORERS IT IS A TRUE INDICTMENT 
THE CAPITALIST CLASS HAS MISMANAGED  IN FACE OF THE FACTS THAT MODERN
MAN LIVES MORE WRETCHEDLY THAN THE CAVEMAN  AND THAT HIS PRODUCING
POWER IS A THOUSAND TIMES GREATER THAN THAT OF THE CAVEMAN  NO OTHER
CONCLUSION IS POSSIBLE THAN THAT THE CAPITALIST CLASS HAS MISMANAGED 
THAT YOU HAVE MISMANAGED  MY MASTERS  THAT YOU HAVE CRIMINALLY AND
SELFISHLY MISMANAGED  AND ON THIS COUNT YOU CANNOT ANSWER ME HERE
TONIGHT  FACE TO FACE  ANY MORE THAN CAN YOUR WHOLE CLASS ANSWER THE
MILLION AND A HALF OF REVOLUTIONISTS IN THE UNITED STATES  YOU CANNOT
ANSWER  I CHALLENGE YOU TO ANSWER  AND FURTHERMORE  I DARE TO SAY TO
YOU NOW THAT WHEN I HAVE FINISHED YOU WILL NOT ANSWER  ON THAT POINT
YOU WILL BE TONGUETIED  THOUGH YOU WILL TALK WORDILY ENOUGH ABOUT OTHER
THINGS 

YOU HAVE FAILED IN YOUR MANAGEMENT  YOU HAVE MADE A SHAMBLES OF
CIVILIZATION  YOU HAVE BEEN BLIND AND GREEDY  YOU HAVE RISEN UP AS YOU
TODAY RISE UP  SHAMELESSLY  IN OUR LEGISLATIVE HALLS  AND DECLARED
THAT PROFITS WERE IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE TOIL OF CHILDREN AND BABES 
DONT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT  IT IS ALL IN THE RECORDS AGAINST YOU  YOU
HAVE LULLED YOUR CONSCIENCE TO SLEEP WITH PRATTLE OF SWEET IDEALS AND
DEAR MORALITIES  YOU ARE FAT WITH POWER AND POSSESSION  DRUNKEN WITH
SUCCESS AND YOU HAVE NO MORE HOPE AGAINST US THAN HAVE THE DRONES 
CLUSTERED ABOUT THE HONEYVATS  WHEN THE WORKERBEES SPRING UPON THEM
TO END THEIR ROTUND EXISTENCE  YOU HAVE FAILED IN YOUR MANAGEMENT OF
SOCIETY  AND YOUR MANAGEMENT IS TO BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU  A MILLION AND
A HALF OF THE MEN OF THE WORKING CLASS SAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET
THE REST OF THE WORKING CLASS TO JOIN WITH THEM AND TAKE THE MANAGEMENT
AWAY FROM YOU  THIS IS THE REVOLUTION  MY MASTERS  STOP IT IF YOU CAN 

FOR AN APPRECIABLE LAPSE OF TIME ERNESTS VOICE CONTINUED TO RING
THROUGH THE GREAT ROOM  THEN AROSE THE THROATY RUMBLE I HAD HEARD
BEFORE  AND A DOZEN MEN WERE ON THEIR FEET CLAMORING FOR RECOGNITION
FROM COLONEL VAN GILBERT  I NOTICED MISS BRENTWOODS SHOULDERS MOVING
CONVULSIVELY  AND FOR THE MOMENT I WAS ANGRY  FOR I THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS
LAUGHING AT ERNEST  AND THEN I DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS NOT LAUGHTER 
BUT HYSTERIA  SHE WAS APPALLED BY WHAT SHE HAD DONE IN BRINGING THIS
FIREBRAND BEFORE HER BLESSED PHILOMATH CLUB 

COLONEL VAN GILBERT DID NOT NOTICE THE DOZEN MEN  WITH PASSIONWROUGHT
FACES  WHO STROVE TO GET PERMISSION FROM HIM TO SPEAK  HIS OWN FACE
WAS PASSIONWROUGHT  HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET  WAVING HIS ARMS  AND FOR A
MOMENT COULD UTTER ONLY INCOHERENT SOUNDS  THEN SPEECH POURED FROM HIM 
BUT IT WAS NOT THE SPEECH OF A ONEHUNDREDTHOUSANDDOLLAR LAWYER  NOR
WAS THE RHETORIC OLDFASHIONED 

FALLACY UPON FALLACY HE CRIED  NEVER IN ALL MY LIFE HAVE I HEARD SO
MANY FALLACIES UTTERED IN ONE SHORT HOUR  AND BESIDES  YOUNG MAN  I MUST
TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE SAID NOTHING NEW  I LEARNED ALL THAT AT COLLEGE
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN  JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU ENUNCIATED YOUR SOCIALISTIC
THEORY NEARLY TWO CENTURIES AGO  A RETURN TO THE SOIL  FORSOOTH
REVERSION OUR BIOLOGY TEACHES THE ABSURDITY OF IT  IT HAS BEEN
TRULY SAID THAT A LITTLE LEARNING IS A DANGEROUS THING  AND YOU HAVE
EXEMPLIFIED IT TONIGHT WITH YOUR MADCAP THEORIES  FALLACY UPON FALLACY
I WAS NEVER SO NAUSEATED IN MY LIFE WITH OVERPLUS OF FALLACY  THAT FOR
YOUR IMMATURE GENERALIZATIONS AND CHILDISH REASONINGS

HE SNAPPED HIS FINGERS CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND PROCEEDED TO SIT DOWN  THERE
WERE LIPEXCLAMATIONS OF APPROVAL ON THE PART OF THE WOMEN  AND HOARSER
NOTES OF CONFIRMATION CAME FROM THE MEN  AS FOR THE DOZEN MEN WHO
WERE CLAMORING FOR THE FLOOR  HALF OF THEM BEGAN SPEAKING AT ONCE  THE
CONFUSION AND BABEL WAS INDESCRIBABLE  NEVER HAD MRS  PERTONWAITHES
SPACIOUS WALLS BEHELD SUCH A SPECTACLE  THESE  THEN  WERE THE COOL
CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY AND LORDS OF SOCIETY  THESE SNARLING  GROWLING
SAVAGES IN EVENING CLOTHES  TRULY ERNEST HAD SHAKEN THEM WHEN HE
STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS FOR THEIR MONEYBAGS  HIS HANDS THAT HAD
APPEARED IN THEIR EYES AS THE HANDS OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND
REVOLUTIONISTS 

BUT ERNEST NEVER LOST HIS HEAD IN A SITUATION  BEFORE COLONEL VAN
GILBERT HAD SUCCEEDED IN SITTING DOWN  ERNEST WAS ON HIS FEET AND HAD
SPRUNG FORWARD 

ONE AT A TIME HE ROARED AT THEM 

THE SOUND AROSE FROM HIS GREAT LUNGS AND DOMINATED THE HUMAN TEMPEST  BY
SHEER COMPULSION OF PERSONALITY HE COMMANDED SILENCE 

ONE AT A TIME  HE REPEATED SOFTLY  LET ME ANSWER COLONEL VAN GILBERT 
AFTER THAT THE REST OF YOU CAN COME AT MEBUT ONE AT A TIME  REMEMBER 
NO MASSPLAYS HERE  THIS IS NOT A FOOTBALL FIELD 

AS FOR YOU  HE WENT ON  TURNING TOWARD COLONEL VAN GILBERT  YOU HAVE
REPLIED TO NOTHING I HAVE SAID  YOU HAVE MERELY MADE A FEW EXCITED AND
DOGMATIC ASSERTIONS ABOUT MY MENTAL CALIBER  THAT MAY SERVE YOU IN YOUR
BUSINESS  BUT YOU CANT TALK TO ME LIKE THAT  I AM NOT A WORKINGMAN 
CAP IN HAND  ASKING YOU TO INCREASE MY WAGES OR TO PROTECT ME FROM THE
MACHINE AT WHICH I WORK  YOU CANNOT BE DOGMATIC WITH TRUTH WHEN YOU DEAL
WITH ME  SAVE THAT FOR DEALING WITH YOUR WAGESLAVES  THEY WILL NOT DARE
REPLY TO YOU BECAUSE YOU HOLD THEIR BREAD AND BUTTER  THEIR LIVES  IN
YOUR HANDS 

AS FOR THIS RETURN TO NATURE THAT YOU SAY YOU LEARNED AT COLLEGE BEFORE
I WAS BORN  PERMIT ME TO POINT OUT THAT ON THE FACE OF IT YOU CANNOT
HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING SINCE  SOCIALISM HAS NO MORE TO DO WITH THE STATE
OF NATURE THAN HAS DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS WITH A BIBLE CLASS  I HAVE
CALLED YOUR CLASS STUPID WHEN OUTSIDE THE REALM OF BUSINESS  YOU  SIR 
HAVE BRILLIANTLY EXEMPLIFIED MY STATEMENT 

THIS TERRIBLE CASTIGATION OF HER HUNDREDTHOUSANDDOLLAR LAWYER WAS TOO
MUCH FOR MISS BRENTWOODS NERVES  HER HYSTERIA BECAME VIOLENT  AND SHE
WAS HELPED  WEEPING AND LAUGHING  OUT OF THE ROOM  IT WAS JUST AS WELL 
FOR THERE WAS WORSE TO FOLLOW 

DONT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT  ERNEST CONTINUED  WHEN THE INTERRUPTION HAD
BEEN LED AWAY  YOUR OWN AUTHORITIES WITH ONE UNANIMOUS VOICE WILL PROVE
YOU STUPID  YOUR OWN HIRED PURVEYORS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU
ARE WRONG  GO TO YOUR MEEKEST LITTLE ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR OF SOCIOLOGY
AND ASK HIM WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ROUSSEAUS THEORY OF THE
RETURN TO NATURE AND THE THEORY OF SOCIALISM ASK YOUR GREATEST ORTHODOX
BOURGEOIS POLITICAL ECONOMISTS AND SOCIOLOGISTS QUESTION THROUGH
THE PAGES OF EVERY TEXTBOOK WRITTEN ON THE SUBJECT AND STORED ON THE
SHELVES OF YOUR SUBSIDIZED LIBRARIES AND FROM ONE AND ALL THE ANSWER
WILL BE THAT THERE IS NOTHING CONGRUOUS BETWEEN THE RETURN TO NATURE AND
SOCIALISM  ON THE OTHER HAND  THE UNANIMOUS AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER WILL BE
THAT THE RETURN TO NATURE AND SOCIALISM ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO
EACH OTHER  AS I SAY  DONT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT  THE RECORD OF YOUR
STUPIDITY IS THERE IN THE BOOKS  YOUR OWN BOOKS THAT YOU NEVER READ  AND
SO FAR AS YOUR STUPIDITY IS CONCERNED  YOU ARE BUT THE EXEMPLAR OF YOUR
CLASS 

YOU KNOW LAW AND BUSINESS  COLONEL VAN GILBERT  YOU KNOW HOW TO SERVE
CORPORATIONS AND INCREASE DIVIDENDS BY TWISTING THE LAW  VERY GOOD 
STICK TO IT  YOU ARE QUITE A FIGURE  YOU ARE A VERY GOOD LAWYER  BUT YOU
ARE A POOR HISTORIAN  YOU KNOW NOTHING OF SOCIOLOGY  AND YOUR BIOLOGY IS
CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH PLINY 

HERE COLONEL VAN GILBERT WRITHED IN HIS CHAIR  THERE WAS PERFECT QUIET
IN THE ROOM  EVERYBODY SAT FASCINATEDPARALYZED  I MAY SAY  SUCH
FEARFUL TREATMENT OF THE GREAT COLONEL VAN GILBERT WAS UNHEARD OF 
UNDREAMED OF  IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVETHE GREAT COLONEL VAN GILBERT
BEFORE WHOM JUDGES TREMBLED WHEN HE AROSE IN COURT  BUT ERNEST NEVER
GAVE QUARTER TO AN ENEMY 

THIS IS  OF COURSE  NO REFLECTION ON YOU  ERNEST SAID  EVERY MAN TO
HIS TRADE  ONLY YOU STICK TO YOUR TRADE  AND ILL STICK TO MINE  YOU
HAVE SPECIALIZED  WHEN IT COMES TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW  OF HOW
BEST TO EVADE THE LAW OR MAKE NEW LAW FOR THE BENEFIT OF THIEVING
CORPORATIONS  I AM DOWN IN THE DIRT AT YOUR FEET  BUT WHEN IT COMES TO
SOCIOLOGYMY TRADEYOU ARE DOWN IN THE DIRT AT MY FEET  REMEMBER THAT 
REMEMBER  ALSO  THAT YOUR LAW IS THE STUFF OF A DAY  AND THAT YOU ARE
NOT VERSATILE IN THE STUFF OF MORE THAN A DAY  THEREFORE YOUR
DOGMATIC ASSERTIONS AND RASH GENERALIZATIONS ON THINGS HISTORICAL AND
SOCIOLOGICAL ARE NOT WORTH THE BREATH YOU WASTE ON THEM 

ERNEST PAUSED FOR A MOMENT AND REGARDED HIM THOUGHTFULLY  NOTING HIS
FACE DARK AND TWISTED WITH ANGER  HIS PANTING CHEST  HIS WRITHING BODY 
AND HIS SLIM WHITE HANDS NERVOUSLY CLENCHING AND UNCLENCHING 

BUT IT SEEMS YOU HAVE BREATH TO USE  AND ILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO
USE IT  I INDICTED YOUR CLASS  SHOW ME THAT MY INDICTMENT IS WRONG  I
POINTED OUT TO YOU THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MODERN MANTHREE MILLION CHILD
SLAVES IN THE UNITED STATES  WITHOUT WHOSE LABOR PROFITS WOULD NOT BE
POSSIBLE  AND FIFTEEN MILLION UNDERFED  ILLCLOTHED  AND WORSEHOUSED
PEOPLE  I POINTED OUT THAT MODERN MANS PRODUCING POWER THROUGH SOCIAL
ORGANIZATION AND THE USE OF MACHINERY WAS A THOUSAND TIMES GREATER THAN
THAT OF THE CAVEMAN  AND I STATED THAT FROM THESE TWO FACTS NO OTHER
CONCLUSION WAS POSSIBLE THAN THAT THE CAPITALIST CLASS HAD MISMANAGED 
THIS WAS MY INDICTMENT  AND I SPECIFICALLY AND AT LENGTH CHALLENGED YOU
TO ANSWER IT  NAY  I DID MORE  I PROPHESIED THAT YOU WOULD NOT ANSWER 
IT REMAINS FOR YOUR BREATH TO SMASH MY PROPHECY  YOU CALLED MY SPEECH
FALLACY  SHOW THE FALLACY  COLONEL VAN GILBERT  ANSWER THE INDICTMENT
THAT I AND MY FIFTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND COMRADES HAVE BROUGHT AGAINST
YOUR CLASS AND YOU 

COLONEL VAN GILBERT QUITE FORGOT THAT HE WAS PRESIDING  AND THAT IN
COURTESY HE SHOULD PERMIT THE OTHER CLAMORERS TO SPEAK  HE WAS ON HIS
FEET  FLINGING HIS ARMS  HIS RHETORIC  AND HIS CONTROL TO THE WINDS 
ALTERNATELY ABUSING ERNEST FOR HIS YOUTH AND DEMAGOGUERY  AND
SAVAGELY ATTACKING THE WORKING CLASS  ELABORATING ITS INEFFICIENCY AND
WORTHLESSNESS 

FOR A LAWYER  YOU ARE THE HARDEST MAN TO KEEP TO A POINT I EVER SAW 
ERNEST BEGAN HIS ANSWER TO THE TIRADE  MY YOUTH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
WHAT I HAVE ENUNCIATED  NOR HAS THE WORTHLESSNESS OF THE WORKING CLASS 
I CHARGED THE CAPITALIST CLASS WITH HAVING MISMANAGED SOCIETY  YOU HAVE
NOT ANSWERED  YOU HAVE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO ANSWER  WHY IS IT BECAUSE YOU
HAVE NO ANSWER YOU ARE THE CHAMPION OF THIS WHOLE AUDIENCE  EVERY
ONE HERE  EXCEPT ME  IS HANGING ON YOUR LIPS FOR THAT ANSWER  THEY
ARE HANGING ON YOUR LIPS FOR THAT ANSWER BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO ANSWER
THEMSELVES  AS FOR ME  AS I SAID BEFORE  I KNOW THAT YOU NOT ONLY CANNOT
ANSWER  BUT THAT YOU WILL NOT ATTEMPT AN ANSWER 

THIS IS INTOLERABLE COLONEL VAN GILBERT CRIED OUT  THIS IS INSULT

THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ANSWER IS INTOLERABLE  ERNEST REPLIED GRAVELY 
NO MAN CAN BE INTELLECTUALLY INSULTED  INSULT  IN ITS VERY NATURE 
IS EMOTIONAL  RECOVER YOURSELF  GIVE ME AN INTELLECTUAL ANSWER TO MY
INTELLECTUAL CHARGE THAT THE CAPITALIST CLASS HAS MISMANAGED SOCIETY 

COLONEL VAN GILBERT REMAINED SILENT  A SULLEN  SUPERIOR EXPRESSION ON
HIS FACE  SUCH AS WILL APPEAR ON THE FACE OF A MAN WHO WILL NOT BANDY
WORDS WITH A RUFFIAN 

DO NOT BE DOWNCAST  ERNEST SAID  TAKE CONSOLATION IN THE FACT THAT
NO MEMBER OF YOUR CLASS HAS EVER YET ANSWERED THAT CHARGE  HE TURNED TO
THE OTHER MEN WHO WERE ANXIOUS TO SPEAK  AND NOW ITS YOUR CHANCE  FIRE
AWAY  AND DO NOT FORGET THAT I HERE CHALLENGE YOU TO GIVE THE ANSWER
THAT COLONEL VAN GILBERT HAS FAILED TO GIVE 

IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO WRITE ALL THAT WAS SAID IN THE
DISCUSSION  I NEVER REALIZED BEFORE HOW MANY WORDS COULD BE SPOKEN IN
THREE SHORT HOURS  AT ANY RATE  IT WAS GLORIOUS  THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS
GREW EXCITED  THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM  HE HAD AN
ENCYCLOPAEDIC COMMAND OF THE FIELD OF KNOWLEDGE  AND BY A WORD OR A
PHRASE  BY DELICATE RAPIER THRUSTS  HE PUNCTURED THEM  HE NAMED THE
POINTS OF THEIR ILLOGIC  THIS WAS A FALSE SYLLOGISM  THAT CONCLUSION HAD
NO CONNECTION WITH THE PREMISE  WHILE THAT NEXT PREMISE WAS AN IMPOSTOR
BECAUSE IT HAD CUNNINGLY HIDDEN IN IT THE CONCLUSION THAT WAS BEING
ATTEMPTED TO BE PROVED  THIS WAS AN ERROR  THAT WAS AN ASSUMPTION  AND
THE NEXT WAS AN ASSERTION CONTRARY TO ASCERTAINED TRUTH AS PRINTED IN
ALL THE TEXTBOOKS 

AND SO IT WENT  SOMETIMES HE EXCHANGED THE RAPIER FOR THE CLUB AND WENT
SMASHING AMONGST THEIR THOUGHTS RIGHT AND LEFT  AND ALWAYS HE DEMANDED
FACTS AND REFUSED TO DISCUSS THEORIES  AND HIS FACTS MADE FOR THEM A
WATERLOO  WHEN THEY ATTACKED THE WORKING CLASS  HE ALWAYS RETORTED  THE
POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK THAT IS NO ANSWER TO THE CHARGE THAT
YOUR OWN FACE IS DIRTY  AND TO ONE AND ALL HE SAID  WHY HAVE YOU NOT
ANSWERED THE CHARGE THAT YOUR CLASS HAS MISMANAGED YOU HAVE TALKED
ABOUT OTHER THINGS AND THINGS CONCERNING OTHER THINGS  BUT YOU HAVE NOT
ANSWERED  IS IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO ANSWER

IT WAS AT THE END OF THE DISCUSSION THAT MR  WICKSON SPOKE  HE WAS THE
ONLY ONE THAT WAS COOL  AND ERNEST TREATED HIM WITH A RESPECT HE HAD NOT
ACCORDED THE OTHERS 

NO ANSWER IS NECESSARY  MR  WICKSON SAID WITH SLOW DELIBERATION  I
HAVE FOLLOWED THE WHOLE DISCUSSION WITH AMAZEMENT AND DISGUST  I AM
DISGUSTED WITH YOU GENTLEMEN  MEMBERS OF MY CLASS  YOU HAVE BEHAVED LIKE
FOOLISH LITTLE SCHOOLBOYS  WHAT WITH INTRUDING ETHICS AND THE THUNDER
OF THE COMMON POLITICIAN INTO SUCH A DISCUSSION  YOU HAVE BEEN
OUTGENERALLED AND OUTCLASSED  YOU HAVE BEEN VERY WORDY  AND ALL YOU HAVE
DONE IS BUZZ  YOU HAVE BUZZED LIKE GNATS ABOUT A BEAR  GENTLEMEN  THERE
STANDS THE BEAR HE POINTED AT ERNEST  AND YOUR BUZZING HAS ONLY
TICKLED HIS EARS 

BELIEVE ME  THE SITUATION IS SERIOUS  THAT BEAR REACHED OUT HIS PAWS
TONIGHT TO CRUSH US  HE HAS SAID THERE ARE A MILLION AND A HALF OF
REVOLUTIONISTS IN THE UNITED STATES  THAT IS A FACT  HE HAS SAID THAT
IT IS THEIR INTENTION TO TAKE AWAY FROM US OUR GOVERNMENTS  OUR PALACES 
AND ALL OUR PURPLED EASE  THAT  ALSO  IS A FACT  A CHANGE  A GREAT
CHANGE  IS COMING IN SOCIETY BUT  HAPLY  IT MAY NOT BE THE CHANGE THE
BEAR ANTICIPATES  THE BEAR HAS SAID THAT HE WILL CRUSH US  WHAT IF WE
CRUSH THE BEAR

THE THROATRUMBLE AROSE IN THE GREAT ROOM  AND MAN NODDED TO MAN
WITH INDORSEMENT AND CERTITUDE  THEIR FACES WERE SET HARD  THEY WERE
FIGHTERS  THAT WAS CERTAIN 

BUT NOT BY BUZZING WILL WE CRUSH THE BEAR  MR  WICKSON WENT ON COLDLY
AND DISPASSIONATELY  WE WILL HUNT THE BEAR  WE WILL NOT REPLY TO THE
BEAR IN WORDS  OUR REPLY SHALL BE COUCHED IN TERMS OF LEAD  WE ARE IN
POWER  NOBODY WILL DENY IT  BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN
POWER 

HE TURNED SUDDENLY UPON ERNEST  THE MOMENT WAS DRAMATIC 

THIS  THEN  IS OUR ANSWER  WE HAVE NO WORDS TO WASTE ON YOU  WHEN YOU
REACH OUT YOUR VAUNTED STRONG HANDS FOR OUR PALACES AND PURPLED EASE 
WE WILL SHOW YOU WHAT STRENGTH IS  IN ROAR OF SHELL AND SHRAPNEL AND
IN WHINE OF MACHINEGUNS WILL OUR ANSWER BE COUCHED  WE WILL GRIND YOU
REVOLUTIONISTS DOWN UNDER OUR HEEL  AND WE SHALL WALK UPON YOUR FACES 
THE WORLD IS OURS  WE ARE ITS LORDS  AND OURS IT SHALL REMAIN  AS FOR
THE HOST OF LABOR  IT HAS BEEN IN THE DIRT SINCE HISTORY BEGAN  AND I
READ HISTORY ARIGHT  AND IN THE DIRT IT SHALL REMAIN SO LONG AS I AND
MINE AND THOSE THAT COME AFTER US HAVE THE POWER  THERE IS THE WORD 
IT IS THE KING OF WORDSPOWER  NOT GOD  NOT MAMMON  BUT POWER  POUR IT
OVER YOUR TONGUE TILL IT TINGLES WITH IT  POWER 

      TO SHOW THE TENOR OF THOUGHT  THE FOLLOWING DEFINITION IS
     QUOTED FROM THE CYNICS WORD BOOK  A D   WRITTEN BY
     ONE AMBROSE BIERCE  AN AVOWED AND CONFIRMED MISANTHROPE OF
     THE PERIOD  GRAPESHOT  N   AN ARGUMENT WHICH THE FUTURE IS
     PREPARING IN ANSWER TO THE DEMANDS OF AMERICAN SOCIALISM 

I AM ANSWERED  ERNEST SAID QUIETLY  IT IS THE ONLY ANSWER THAT COULD
BE GIVEN  POWER  IT IS WHAT WE OF THE WORKING CLASS PREACH  WE KNOW 
AND WELL WE KNOW BY BITTER EXPERIENCE  THAT NO APPEAL FOR THE RIGHT  FOR
JUSTICE  FOR HUMANITY  CAN EVER TOUCH YOU  YOUR HEARTS ARE HARD AS
YOUR HEELS WITH WHICH YOU TREAD UPON THE FACES OF THE POOR  SO WE HAVE
PREACHED POWER  BY THE POWER OF OUR BALLOTS ON ELECTION DAY WILL WE TAKE
YOUR GOVERNMENT AWAY FROM YOU

WHAT IF YOU DO GET A MAJORITY  A SWEEPING MAJORITY  ON ELECTION
DAY MR  WICKSON BROKE IN TO DEMAND  SUPPOSE WE REFUSE TO TURN THE
GOVERNMENT OVER TO YOU AFTER YOU HAVE CAPTURED IT AT THE BALLOTBOX

THAT  ALSO  HAVE WE CONSIDERED  ERNEST REPLIED  AND WE SHALL GIVE YOU
AN ANSWER IN TERMS OF LEAD  POWER YOU HAVE PROCLAIMED THE KING OF WORDS 
VERY GOOD  POWER IT SHALL BE  AND IN THE DAY THAT WE SWEEP TO VICTORY AT
THE BALLOTBOX  AND YOU REFUSE TO TURN OVER TO US THE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE
CONSTITUTIONALLY AND PEACEFULLY CAPTURED  AND YOU DEMAND WHAT WE ARE
GOING TO DO ABOUT ITIN THAT DAY  I SAY  WE SHALL ANSWER YOU AND IN
ROAR OF SHELL AND SHRAPNEL AND IN WHINE OF MACHINEGUNS SHALL OUR ANSWER
BE COUCHED 

YOU CANNOT ESCAPE US  IT IS TRUE THAT YOU HAVE READ HISTORY ARIGHT  IT
IS TRUE THAT LABOR HAS FROM THE BEGINNING OF HISTORY BEEN IN THE DIRT 
AND IT IS EQUALLY TRUE THAT SO LONG AS YOU AND YOURS AND THOSE THAT COME
AFTER YOU HAVE POWER  THAT LABOR SHALL REMAIN IN THE DIRT  I AGREE WITH
YOU  I AGREE WITH ALL THAT YOU HAVE SAID  POWER WILL BE THE ARBITER 
AS IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN THE ARBITER  IT IS A STRUGGLE OF CLASSES  JUST AS
YOUR CLASS DRAGGED DOWN THE OLD FEUDAL NOBILITY  SO SHALL IT BE DRAGGED
DOWN BY MY CLASS  THE WORKING CLASS  IF YOU WILL READ YOUR BIOLOGY AND
YOUR SOCIOLOGY AS CLEARLY AS YOU DO YOUR HISTORY  YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS
END I HAVE DESCRIBED IS INEVITABLE  IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER IT IS IN
ONE YEAR  TEN  OR A THOUSANDYOUR CLASS SHALL BE DRAGGED DOWN  AND IT
SHALL BE DONE BY POWER  WE OF THE LABOR HOSTS HAVE CONNED THAT WORD OVER
TILL OUR MINDS ARE ALL ATINGLE WITH IT  POWER  IT IS A KINGLY WORD 

AND SO ENDED THE NIGHT WITH THE PHILOMATHS 



CHAPTER VI

ADUMBRATIONS


IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT THE WARNINGS OF COMING EVENTS BEGAN TO FALL
ABOUT US THICK AND FAST  ERNEST HAD ALREADY QUESTIONED FATHERS POLICY
OF HAVING SOCIALISTS AND LABOR LEADERS AT HIS HOUSE  AND OF OPENLY
ATTENDING SOCIALIST MEETINGS AND FATHER HAD ONLY LAUGHED AT HIM FOR
HIS PAINS  AS FOR MYSELF  I WAS LEARNING MUCH FROM THIS CONTACT WITH THE
WORKINGCLASS LEADERS AND THINKERS  I WAS SEEING THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE SHIELD  I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE UNSELFISHNESS AND HIGH IDEALISM
I ENCOUNTERED  THOUGH I WAS APPALLED BY THE VAST PHILOSOPHIC AND
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE OF SOCIALISM THAT WAS OPENED UP TO ME  I WAS
LEARNING FAST  BUT I LEARNED NOT FAST ENOUGH TO REALIZE THEN THE PERIL
OF OUR POSITION 

THERE WERE WARNINGS  BUT I DID NOT HEED THEM  FOR INSTANCE  MRS 
PERTONWAITHE AND MRS  WICKSON EXERCISED TREMENDOUS SOCIAL POWER IN
THE UNIVERSITY TOWN  AND FROM THEM EMANATED THE SENTIMENT THAT I WAS A
TOOFORWARD AND SELFASSERTIVE YOUNG WOMAN WITH A MISCHIEVOUS PENCHANT
FOR OFFICIOUSNESS AND INTERFERENCE IN OTHER PERSONS AFFAIRS  THIS
I THOUGHT NO MORE THAN NATURAL  CONSIDERING THE PART I HAD PLAYED
IN INVESTIGATING THE CASE OF JACKSONS ARM  BUT THE EFFECT OF SUCH
A SENTIMENT  ENUNCIATED BY TWO SUCH POWERFUL SOCIAL ARBITERS  I
UNDERESTIMATED 

TRUE  I NOTICED A CERTAIN ALOOFNESS ON THE PART OF MY GENERAL FRIENDS 
BUT THIS I ASCRIBED TO THE DISAPPROVAL THAT WAS PREVALENT IN MY CIRCLES
OF MY INTENDED MARRIAGE WITH ERNEST  IT WAS NOT TILL SOME TIME AFTERWARD
THAT ERNEST POINTED OUT TO ME CLEARLY THAT THIS GENERAL ATTITUDE OF
MY CLASS WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN SPONTANEOUS  THAT BEHIND IT WERE THE
HIDDEN SPRINGS OF AN ORGANIZED CONDUCT  YOU HAVE GIVEN SHELTER TO AN
ENEMY OF YOUR CLASS  HE SAID  AND NOT ALONE SHELTER  FOR YOU HAVE
GIVEN YOUR LOVE  YOURSELF  THIS IS TREASON TO YOUR CLASS  THINK NOT THAT
YOU WILL ESCAPE BEING PENALIZED 

BUT IT WAS BEFORE THIS THAT FATHER RETURNED ONE AFTERNOON  ERNEST WAS
WITH ME  AND WE COULD SEE THAT FATHER WAS ANGRYPHILOSOPHICALLY ANGRY 
HE WAS RARELY REALLY ANGRY BUT A CERTAIN MEASURE OF CONTROLLED ANGER
HE ALLOWED HIMSELF  HE CALLED IT A TONIC  AND WE COULD SEE THAT HE WAS
TONICANGRY WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM 

WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DEMANDED  I HAD LUNCHEON WITH WILCOX 

WILCOX WAS THE SUPERANNUATED PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY  WHOSE WITHERED
MIND WAS STORED WITH GENERALIZATIONS THAT WERE YOUNG IN   AND WHICH
HE HAD SINCE FAILED TO REVISE 

I WAS INVITED  FATHER ANNOUNCED  I WAS SENT FOR 

HE PAUSED  AND WE WAITED 

OH  IT WAS DONE VERY NICELY  ILL ALLOW BUT I WAS REPRIMANDED  I AND
BY THAT OLD FOSSIL

ILL WAGER I KNOW WHAT YOU WERE REPRIMANDED FOR  ERNEST SAID 

NOT IN THREE GUESSES  FATHER LAUGHED 

ONE GUESS WILL DO  ERNEST RETORTED  AND IT WONT BE A GUESS  IT WILL
BE A DEDUCTION  YOU WERE REPRIMANDED FOR YOUR PRIVATE LIFE 

THE VERY THING FATHER CRIED  HOW DID YOU GUESS

I KNEW IT WAS COMING  I WARNED YOU BEFORE ABOUT IT 

YES  YOU DID  FATHER MEDITATED  BUT I COULDNT BELIEVE IT  AT ANY
RATE  IT IS ONLY SO MUCH MORE CLINCHING EVIDENCE FOR MY BOOK 

IT IS NOTHING TO WHAT WILL COME  ERNEST WENT ON  IF YOU PERSIST IN
YOUR POLICY OF HAVING THESE SOCIALISTS AND RADICALS OF ALL SORTS AT YOUR
HOUSE  MYSELF INCLUDED 

JUST WHAT OLD WILCOX SAID  AND OF ALL UNWARRANTED THINGS HE SAID IT
WAS IN POOR TASTE  UTTERLY PROFITLESS  ANYWAY  AND NOT IN HARMONY WITH
UNIVERSITY TRADITIONS AND POLICY  HE SAID MUCH MORE OF THE SAME VAGUE
SORT  AND I COULDNT PIN HIM DOWN TO ANYTHING SPECIFIC  I MADE IT PRETTY
AWKWARD FOR HIM  AND HE COULD ONLY GO ON REPEATING HIMSELF AND TELLING
ME HOW MUCH HE HONORED ME  AND ALL THE WORLD HONORED ME  AS A SCIENTIST 
IT WASNT AN AGREEABLE TASK FOR HIM  I COULD SEE HE DIDNT LIKE IT 

HE WAS NOT A FREE AGENT  ERNEST SAID  THE LEGBAR IS NOT ALWAYS WORN
GRACIOUSLY 

      LEGBARTHE AFRICAN SLAVES WERE SO MANACLED ALSO
     CRIMINALS   IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE COMING OF THE BROTHERHOOD
     OF MAN THAT THE LEGBAR PASSED OUT OF USE 

YES  I GOT THAT MUCH OUT OF HIM  HE SAID THE UNIVERSITY NEEDED EVER
SO MUCH MORE MONEY THIS YEAR THAN THE STATE WAS WILLING TO FURNISH AND
THAT IT MUST COME FROM WEALTHY PERSONAGES WHO COULD NOT BUT BE OFFENDED
BY THE SWERVING OF THE UNIVERSITY FROM ITS HIGH IDEAL OF THE PASSIONLESS
PURSUIT OF PASSIONLESS INTELLIGENCE  WHEN I TRIED TO PIN HIM DOWN TO
WHAT MY HOME LIFE HAD TO DO WITH SWERVING THE UNIVERSITY FROM ITS HIGH
IDEAL  HE OFFERED ME A TWO YEARS VACATION  ON FULL PAY  IN EUROPE 
FOR RECREATION AND RESEARCH  OF COURSE I COULDNT ACCEPT IT UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES 

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER IF YOU HAD  ERNEST SAID GRAVELY 

IT WAS A BRIBE  FATHER PROTESTED AND ERNEST NODDED 

ALSO  THE BEGGAR SAID THAT THERE WAS TALK  TEATABLE GOSSIP AND SO
FORTH  ABOUT MY DAUGHTER BEING SEEN IN PUBLIC WITH SO NOTORIOUS A
CHARACTER AS YOU  AND THAT IT WAS NOT IN KEEPING WITH UNIVERSITY TONE
AND DIGNITY  NOT THAT HE PERSONALLY OBJECTEDOH  NO BUT THAT THERE WAS
TALK AND THAT I WOULD UNDERSTAND 

ERNEST CONSIDERED THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FOR A MOMENT  AND THEN SAID  AND HIS
FACE WAS VERY GRAVE  WITHAL THERE WAS A SOMBRE WRATH IN IT 

THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL  SOMEBODY HAS
PUT PRESSURE ON PRESIDENT WILCOX 

DO YOU THINK SO FATHER ASKED  AND HIS FACE SHOWED THAT HE WAS
INTERESTED RATHER THAN FRIGHTENED 

I WISH I COULD CONVEY TO YOU THE CONCEPTION THAT IS DIMLY FORMING IN MY
OWN MIND  ERNEST SAID  NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAS SOCIETY
IN SO TERRIFIC FLUX AS IT IS RIGHT NOW  THE SWIFT CHANGES IN OUR
INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM ARE CAUSING EQUALLY SWIFT CHANGES IN OUR RELIGIOUS 
POLITICAL  AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES  AN UNSEEN AND FEARFUL REVOLUTION IS
TAKING PLACE IN THE FIBRE AND STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY  ONE CAN ONLY DIMLY
FEEL THESE THINGS  BUT THEY ARE IN THE AIR  NOW  TODAY  ONE CAN FEEL
THE LOOM OF THEMTHINGS VAST  VAGUE  AND TERRIBLE  MY MIND RECOILS FROM
CONTEMPLATION OF WHAT THEY MAY CRYSTALLIZE INTO  YOU HEARD WICKSON TALK
THE OTHER NIGHT  BEHIND WHAT HE SAID WERE THE SAME NAMELESS  FORMLESS
THINGS THAT I FEEL  HE SPOKE OUT OF A SUPERCONSCIOUS APPREHENSION OF
THEM 

YOU MEAN        FATHER BEGAN  THEN PAUSED 

I MEAN THAT THERE IS A SHADOW OF SOMETHING COLOSSAL AND MENACING THAT
EVEN NOW IS BEGINNING TO FALL ACROSS THE LAND  CALL IT THE SHADOW OF AN
OLIGARCHY  IF YOU WILL IT IS THE NEAREST I DARE APPROXIMATE IT  WHAT
ITS NATURE MAY BE I REFUSE TO IMAGINE  BUT WHAT I WANTED TO SAY WAS
THIS  YOU ARE IN A PERILOUS POSITIONA PERIL THAT MY OWN FEAR ENHANCES
BECAUSE I AM NOT ABLE EVEN TO MEASURE IT  TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE
VACATION 

      THOUGH  LIKE EVERHARD  THEY DID NOT DREAM OF THE NATURE OF
     IT  THERE WERE MEN  EVEN BEFORE HIS TIME  WHO CAUGHT
     GLIMPSES OF THE SHADOW   JOHN C  CALHOUN SAID  A POWER HAS
     RISEN UP IN THE GOVERNMENT GREATER THAN THE PEOPLE
     THEMSELVES  CONSISTING OF MANY AND VARIOUS AND POWERFUL
     INTERESTS  COMBINED INTO ONE MASS  AND HELD TOGETHER BY THE
     COHESIVE POWER OF THE VAST SURPLUS IN THE BANKS   AND THAT
     GREAT HUMANIST  ABRAHAM LINCOLN  SAID  JUST BEFORE HIS
     ASSASSINATION  I SEE IN THE NEAR FUTURE A CRISIS
     APPROACHING THAT UNNERVES ME AND CAUSES ME TO TREMBLE FOR
     THE SAFETY OF MY COUNTRY         CORPORATIONS HAVE BEEN
     ENTHRONED  AN ERA OF CORRUPTION IN HIGH PLACES WILL FOLLOW 
     AND THE MONEYPOWER OF THE COUNTRY WILL ENDEAVOR TO PROLONG
     ITS REIGN BY WORKING UPON THE PREJUDICES OF THE PEOPLE UNTIL
     THE WEALTH IS AGGREGATED IN A FEW HANDS AND THE REPUBLIC IS
     DESTROYED 

BUT IT WOULD BE COWARDLY  WAS THE PROTEST 

NOT AT ALL  YOU ARE AN OLD MAN  YOU HAVE DONE YOUR WORK IN THE WORLD 
AND A GREAT WORK  LEAVE THE PRESENT BATTLE TO YOUTH AND STRENGTH  WE
YOUNG FELLOWS HAVE OUR WORK YET TO DO  AVIS WILL STAND BY MY SIDE IN
WHAT IS TO COME  SHE WILL BE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE IN THE BATTLEFRONT 

BUT THEY CANT HURT ME  FATHER OBJECTED  THANK GOD I AM INDEPENDENT 
OH  I ASSURE YOU  I KNOW THE FRIGHTFUL PERSECUTION THEY CAN WAGE ON
A PROFESSOR WHO IS ECONOMICALLY DEPENDENT ON HIS UNIVERSITY  BUT I AM
INDEPENDENT  I HAVE NOT BEEN A PROFESSOR FOR THE SAKE OF MY SALARY  I
CAN GET ALONG VERY COMFORTABLY ON MY OWN INCOME  AND THE SALARY IS ALL
THEY CAN TAKE AWAY FROM ME 

BUT YOU DO NOT REALIZE  ERNEST ANSWERED  IF ALL THAT I FEAR BE SO 
YOUR PRIVATE INCOME  YOUR PRINCIPAL ITSELF  CAN BE TAKEN FROM YOU JUST
AS EASILY AS YOUR SALARY 

FATHER WAS SILENT FOR A FEW MINUTES  HE WAS THINKING DEEPLY  AND I COULD
SEE THE LINES OF DECISION FORMING IN HIS FACE  AT LAST HE SPOKE 

I SHALL NOT TAKE THE VACATION  HE PAUSED AGAIN  I SHALL GO ON WITH
MY BOOK  YOU MAY BE WRONG  BUT WHETHER YOU ARE WRONG OR RIGHT  I SHALL
STAND BY MY GUNS 

      THIS BOOK  ECONOMICS AND EDUCATION  WAS PUBLISHED IN
     THAT YEAR  THREE COPIES OF IT ARE EXTANT TWO AT ARDIS  AND
     ONE AT ASGARD   IT DEALT  IN ELABORATE DETAIL  WITH ONE
     FACTOR IN THE PERSISTENCE OF THE ESTABLISHED  NAMELY  THE
     CAPITALISTIC BIAS OF THE UNIVERSITIES AND COMMON SCHOOLS 
     IT WAS A LOGICAL AND CRUSHING INDICTMENT OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM
     OF EDUCATION THAT DEVELOPED IN THE MINDS OF THE STUDENTS
     ONLY SUCH IDEAS AS WERE FAVORABLE TO THE CAPITALISTIC
     REGIME  TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL IDEAS THAT WERE INIMICAL AND
     SUBVERSIVE   THE BOOK CREATED A FUROR  AND WAS PROMPTLY
     SUPPRESSED BY THE OLIGARCHY 

ALL RIGHT  ERNEST SAID  YOU ARE TRAVELLING THE SAME PATH THAT BISHOP
MOREHOUSE IS  AND TOWARD A SIMILAR SMASHUP  YOULL BOTH BE PROLETARIANS
BEFORE YOURE DONE WITH IT 

THE CONVERSATION TURNED UPON THE BISHOP  AND WE GOT ERNEST TO EXPLAIN
WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING WITH HIM 

HE IS SOULSICK FROM THE JOURNEY THROUGH HELL I HAVE GIVEN HIM  I TOOK
HIM THROUGH THE HOMES OF A FEW OF OUR FACTORY WORKERS  I SHOWED HIM THE
HUMAN WRECKS CAST ASIDE BY THE INDUSTRIAL MACHINE  AND HE LISTENED TO
THEIR LIFE STORIES  I TOOK HIM THROUGH THE SLUMS OF SAN FRANCISCO  AND
IN DRUNKENNESS  PROSTITUTION  AND CRIMINALITY HE LEARNED A DEEPER CAUSE
THAN INNATE DEPRAVITY  HE IS VERY SICK  AND  WORSE THAN THAT  HE HAS GOT
OUT OF HAND  HE IS TOO ETHICAL  HE HAS BEEN TOO SEVERELY TOUCHED  AND 
AS USUAL  HE IS UNPRACTICAL  HE IS UP IN THE AIR WITH ALL KINDS OF
ETHICAL DELUSIONS AND PLANS FOR MISSION WORK AMONG THE CULTURED  HE
FEELS IT IS HIS BOUNDEN DUTY TO RESURRECT THE ANCIENT SPIRIT OF THE
CHURCH AND TO DELIVER ITS MESSAGE TO THE MASTERS  HE IS OVERWROUGHT 
SOONER OR LATER HE IS GOING TO BREAK OUT  AND THEN THERES GOING TO BE
A SMASHUP  WHAT FORM IT WILL TAKE I CANT EVEN GUESS  HE IS A PURE 
EXALTED SOUL  BUT HE IS SO UNPRACTICAL  HES BEYOND ME  I CANT KEEP
HIS FEET ON THE EARTH  AND THROUGH THE AIR HE IS RUSHING ON TO HIS
GETHSEMANE  AND AFTER THIS HIS CRUCIFIXION  SUCH HIGH SOULS ARE MADE FOR
CRUCIFIXION 

AND YOU I ASKED AND BENEATH MY SMILE WAS THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE
ANXIETY OF LOVE 

NOT I  HE LAUGHED BACK  I MAY BE EXECUTED  OR ASSASSINATED  BUT I
SHALL NEVER BE CRUCIFIED  I AM PLANTED TOO SOLIDLY AND STOLIDLY UPON THE
EARTH 

BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BRING ABOUT THE CRUCIFIXION OF THE BISHOP I ASKED 
YOU WILL NOT DENY THAT YOU ARE THE CAUSE OF IT 

WHY SHOULD I LEAVE ONE COMFORTABLE SOUL IN COMFORT WHEN THERE ARE
MILLIONS IN TRAVAIL AND MISERY HE DEMANDED BACK 

THEN WHY DID YOU ADVISE FATHER TO ACCEPT THE VACATION

BECAUSE I AM NOT A PURE  EXALTED SOUL  WAS THE ANSWER  BECAUSE I AM
SOLID AND STOLID AND SELFISH  BECAUSE I LOVE YOU AND  LIKE RUTH OF
OLD  THY PEOPLE ARE MY PEOPLE  AS FOR THE BISHOP  HE HAS NO DAUGHTER 
BESIDES  NO MATTER HOW SMALL THE GOOD  NEVERTHELESS HIS LITTLE
INADEQUATE WAIL WILL BE PRODUCTIVE OF SOME GOOD IN THE REVOLUTION  AND
EVERY LITTLE BIT COUNTS 

I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST  I KNEW WELL THE NOBLE NATURE OF
BISHOP MOREHOUSE  AND I COULD NOT CONCEIVE THAT HIS VOICE RAISED FOR
RIGHTEOUSNESS WOULD BE NO MORE THAN A LITTLE INADEQUATE WAIL  BUT I DID
NOT YET HAVE THE HARSH FACTS OF LIFE AT MY FINGERS ENDS AS ERNEST HAD 
HE SAW CLEARLY THE FUTILITY OF THE BISHOPS GREAT SOUL  AS COMING EVENTS
WERE SOON TO SHOW AS CLEARLY TO ME 

IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER THIS DAY THAT ERNEST TOLD ME  AS A GOOD STORY  THE
OFFER HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT  NAMELY  AN APPOINTMENT AS
UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER OF LABOR  I WAS OVERJOYED  THE SALARY WAS
COMPARATIVELY LARGE  AND WOULD MAKE SAFE OUR MARRIAGE  AND THEN IT
SURELY WAS CONGENIAL WORK FOR ERNEST  AND  FURTHERMORE  MY JEALOUS PRIDE
IN HIM MADE ME HAIL THE PROFFERED APPOINTMENT AS A RECOGNITION OF HIS
ABILITIES 

THEN I NOTICED THE TWINKLE IN HIS EYES  HE WAS LAUGHING AT ME 

YOU ARE NOT GOING TO       TO DECLINE I QUAVERED 

IT IS A BRIBE  HE SAID  BEHIND IT IS THE FINE HAND OF WICKSON  AND
BEHIND HIM THE HANDS OF GREATER MEN THAN HE  IT IS AN OLD TRICK  OLD AS
THE CLASS STRUGGLE IS OLDSTEALING THE CAPTAINS FROM THE ARMY OF LABOR 
POOR BETRAYED LABOR IF YOU BUT KNEW HOW MANY OF ITS LEADERS HAVE BEEN
BOUGHT OUT IN SIMILAR WAYS IN THE PAST  IT IS CHEAPER  SO MUCH CHEAPER 
TO BUY A GENERAL THAN TO FIGHT HIM AND HIS WHOLE ARMY  THERE WASBUT
ILL NOT CALL ANY NAMES  IM BITTER ENOUGH OVER IT AS IT IS  DEAR HEART 
I AM A CAPTAIN OF LABOR  I COULD NOT SELL OUT  IF FOR NO OTHER REASON 
THE MEMORY OF MY POOR OLD FATHER AND THE WAY HE WAS WORKED TO DEATH
WOULD PREVENT 

THE TEARS WERE IN HIS EYES  THIS GREAT  STRONG HERO OF MINE  HE NEVER
COULD FORGIVE THE WAY HIS FATHER HAD BEEN MALFORMEDTHE SORDID LIES AND
THE PETTY THEFTS HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO  IN ORDER TO PUT FOOD IN HIS
CHILDRENS MOUTHS 

MY FATHER WAS A GOOD MAN  ERNEST ONCE SAID TO ME  THE SOUL OF HIM WAS
GOOD  AND YET IT WAS TWISTED  AND MAIMED  AND BLUNTED BY THE SAVAGERY
OF HIS LIFE  HE WAS MADE INTO A BROKENDOWN BEAST BY HIS MASTERS  THE
ARCHBEASTS  HE SHOULD BE ALIVE TODAY  LIKE YOUR FATHER  HE HAD A
STRONG CONSTITUTION  BUT HE WAS CAUGHT IN THE MACHINE AND WORKED TO
DEATHFOR PROFIT  THINK OF IT  FOR PROFITHIS LIFE BLOOD TRANSMUTED
INTO A WINESUPPER  OR A JEWELLED GEWGAW  OR SOME SIMILAR SENSEORGY OF
THE PARASITIC AND IDLE RICH  HIS MASTERS  THE ARCHBEASTS 



CHAPTER VII

THE BISHOPS VISION


THE BISHOP IS OUT OF HAND  ERNEST WROTE ME  HE IS CLEAR UP IN THE
AIR  TONIGHT HE IS GOING TO BEGIN PUTTING TO RIGHTS THIS VERY MISERABLE
WORLD OF OURS  HE IS GOING TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGE  HE HAS TOLD ME SO 
AND I CANNOT DISSUADE HIM  TONIGHT HE IS CHAIRMAN OF THE I P H   AND
HE WILL EMBODY HIS MESSAGE IN HIS INTRODUCTORY REMARKS 

      THERE IS NO CLEW TO THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR WHICH
     THESE INITIALS STAND 

MAY I BRING YOU TO HEAR HIM OF COURSE  HE IS FOREDOOMED TO FUTILITY 
IT WILL BREAK YOUR HEARTIT WILL BREAK HIS BUT FOR YOU IT WILL BE AN
EXCELLENT OBJECT LESSON  YOU KNOW  DEAR HEART  HOW PROUD I AM BECAUSE
YOU LOVE ME  AND BECAUSE OF THAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW MY FULLEST VALUE  I
WANT TO REDEEM  IN YOUR EYES  SOME SMALL MEASURE OF MY UNWORTHINESS 
AND SO IT IS THAT MY PRIDE DESIRES THAT YOU SHALL KNOW MY THINKING IS
CORRECT AND RIGHT  MY VIEWS ARE HARSH THE FUTILITY OF SO NOBLE A SOUL
AS THE BISHOP WILL SHOW YOU THE COMPULSION FOR SUCH HARSHNESS  SO COME
TONIGHT  SAD THOUGH THIS NIGHTS HAPPENING WILL BE  I FEEL THAT IT WILL
BUT DRAW YOU MORE CLOSELY TO ME 

THE I P H  HELD ITS CONVENTION THAT NIGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO  THIS
CONVENTION HAD BEEN CALLED TO CONSIDER PUBLIC IMMORALITY AND THE REMEDY
FOR IT  BISHOP MOREHOUSE PRESIDED  HE WAS VERY NERVOUS AS HE SAT ON THE
PLATFORM  AND I COULD SEE THE HIGH TENSION HE WAS UNDER  BY HIS SIDE
WERE BISHOP DICKINSON H  H  JONES  THE HEAD OF THE ETHICAL DEPARTMENT
IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MRS  W  W  HURD  THE GREAT CHARITY
ORGANIZER PHILIP WARD  THE EQUALLY GREAT PHILANTHROPIST AND SEVERAL
LESSER LUMINARIES IN THE FIELD OF MORALITY AND CHARITY  BISHOP MOREHOUSE
AROSE AND ABRUPTLY BEGAN 

      IT TOOK BUT A FEW MINUTES TO CROSS BY FERRY FROM BERKELEY
     TO SAN FRANCISCO   THESE  AND THE OTHER BAY CITIES 
     PRACTICALLY COMPOSED ONE COMMUNITY 

I WAS IN MY BROUGHAM  DRIVING THROUGH THE STREETS  IT WAS NIGHTTIME 
NOW AND THEN I LOOKED THROUGH THE CARRIAGE WINDOWS  AND SUDDENLY MY EYES
SEEMED TO BE OPENED  AND I SAW THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE  AT FIRST I
COVERED MY EYES WITH MY HANDS TO SHUT OUT THE AWFUL SIGHT  AND THEN  IN
THE DARKNESS  THE QUESTION CAME TO ME  WHAT IS TO BE DONE WHAT IS TO BE
DONE A LITTLE LATER THE QUESTION CAME TO ME IN ANOTHER WAY  WHAT WOULD
THE MASTER DO AND WITH THE QUESTION A GREAT LIGHT SEEMED TO FILL
THE PLACE  AND I SAW MY DUTY SUNCLEAR  AS SAUL SAW HIS ON THE WAY TO
DAMASCUS 

I STOPPED THE CARRIAGE  GOT OUT  AND  AFTER A FEW MINUTES
CONVERSATION  PERSUADED TWO OF THE PUBLIC WOMEN TO GET INTO THE BROUGHAM
WITH ME  IF JESUS WAS RIGHT  THEN THESE TWO UNFORTUNATES WERE MY
SISTERS  AND THE ONLY HOPE OF THEIR PURIFICATION WAS IN MY AFFECTION AND
TENDERNESS 

I LIVE IN ONE OF THE LOVELIEST LOCALITIES OF SAN FRANCISCO  THE HOUSE
IN WHICH I LIVE COST A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS  AND ITS FURNISHINGS 
BOOKS  AND WORKS OF ART COST AS MUCH MORE  THE HOUSE IS A MANSION 
NO  IT IS A PALACE  WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS  I NEVER KNEW WHAT
PALACES WERE GOOD FOR  I HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE TO LIVE IN  BUT NOW I
KNOW  I TOOK THE TWO WOMEN OF THE STREET TO MY PALACE  AND THEY ARE
GOING TO STAY WITH ME  I HOPE TO FILL EVERY ROOM IN MY PALACE WITH SUCH
SISTERS AS THEY 

THE AUDIENCE HAD BEEN GROWING MORE AND MORE RESTLESS AND UNSETTLED  AND
THE FACES OF THOSE THAT SAT ON THE PLATFORM HAD BEEN BETRAYING GREATER
AND GREATER DISMAY AND CONSTERNATION  AND AT THIS POINT BISHOP DICKINSON
AROSE  AND WITH AN EXPRESSION OF DISGUST ON HIS FACE  FLED FROM THE
PLATFORM AND THE HALL  BUT BISHOP MOREHOUSE  OBLIVIOUS TO ALL  HIS EYES
FILLED WITH HIS VISION  CONTINUED 

OH  SISTERS AND BROTHERS  IN THIS ACT OF MINE I FIND THE SOLUTION OF
ALL MY DIFFICULTIES  I DIDNT KNOW WHAT BROUGHAMS WERE MADE FOR  BUT NOW
I KNOW  THEY ARE MADE TO CARRY THE WEAK  THE SICK  AND THE AGED THEY
ARE MADE TO SHOW HONOR TO THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THE SENSE EVEN OF SHAME 

I DID NOT KNOW WHAT PALACES WERE MADE FOR  BUT NOW I HAVE FOUND A USE
FOR THEM  THE PALACES OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE HOSPITALS AND NURSERIES
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE AND ARE PERISHING 

HE MADE A LONG PAUSE  PLAINLY OVERCOME BY THE THOUGHT THAT WAS IN HIM 
AND NERVOUS HOW BEST TO EXPRESS IT 

I AM NOT FIT  DEAR BRETHREN  TO TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT MORALITY  I
HAVE LIVED IN SHAME AND HYPOCRISIES TOO LONG TO BE ABLE TO HELP OTHERS
BUT MY ACTION WITH THOSE WOMEN  SISTERS OF MINE  SHOWS ME THAT THE
BETTER WAY IS EASY TO FIND  TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN JESUS AND HIS GOSPEL
THERE CAN BE NO OTHER RELATION BETWEEN MAN AND MAN THAN THE RELATION
OF AFFECTION  LOVE ALONE IS STRONGER THAN SINSTRONGER THAN DEATH  I
THEREFORE SAY TO THE RICH AMONG YOU THAT IT IS THEIR DUTY TO DO WHAT I
HAVE DONE AND AM DOING  LET EACH ONE OF YOU WHO IS PROSPEROUS TAKE INTO
HIS HOUSE SOME THIEF AND TREAT HIM AS HIS BROTHER  SOME UNFORTUNATE AND
TREAT HER AS HIS SISTER  AND SAN FRANCISCO WILL NEED NO POLICE FORCE
AND NO MAGISTRATES THE PRISONS WILL BE TURNED INTO HOSPITALS  AND THE
CRIMINAL WILL DISAPPEAR WITH HIS CRIME 

WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE  WE MUST DO AS CHRIST
DID THAT IS THE MESSAGE OF THE CHURCH TODAY  WE HAVE WANDERED FAR FROM
THE MASTERS TEACHING  WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESHPOTS  WE HAVE
PUT MAMMON IN THE PLACE OF CHRIST  I HAVE HERE A POEM THAT TELLS THE
WHOLE STORY  I SHOULD LIKE TO READ IT TO YOU  IT WAS WRITTEN BY AN
ERRING SOUL WHO YET SAW CLEARLY  IT MUST NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR AN ATTACK
UPON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH  IT IS AN ATTACK UPON ALL CHURCHES  UPON THE
POMP AND SPLENDOR OF ALL CHURCHES THAT HAVE WANDERED FROM THE MASTERS
PATH AND HEDGED THEMSELVES IN FROM HIS LAMBS  HERE IT IS 

     THE SILVER TRUMPETS RANG ACROSS THE DOME
             THE PEOPLE KNELT UPON THE GROUND WITH AWE
             AND BORNE UPON THE NECKS OF MEN I SAW 
     LIKE SOME GREAT GOD  THE HOLY LORD OF ROME 

     PRIESTLIKE  HE WORE A ROBE MORE WHITE THAN FOAM 
             AND  KINGLIKE  SWATHED HIMSELF IN ROYAL RED 
             THREE CROWNS OF GOLD ROSE HIGH UPON HIS HEAD
     IN SPLENDOR AND IN LIGHT THE POPE PASSED HOME 

     MY HEART STOLE BACK ACROSS WIDE WASTES OF YEARS
             TO ONE WHO WANDERED BY A LONELY SEA
     AND SOUGHT IN VAIN FOR ANY PLACE OF REST 
     FOXES HAVE HOLES  AND EVERY BIRD ITS NEST 
             I  ONLY I  MUST WANDER WEARILY 
     AND BRUISE MY FEET  AND DRINK WINE SALT WITH TEARS 

      OSCAR WILDE  ONE OF THE LORDS OF LANGUAGE OF THE
     NINETEENTH CENTURY OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA 

THE AUDIENCE WAS AGITATED  BUT UNRESPONSIVE  YET BISHOP MOREHOUSE WAS
NOT AWARE OF IT  HE HELD STEADILY ON HIS WAY 

AND SO I SAY TO THE RICH AMONG YOU  AND TO ALL THE RICH  THAT BITTERLY
YOU OPPRESS THE MASTERS LAMBS  YOU HAVE HARDENED YOUR HEARTS  YOU HAVE
CLOSED YOUR EARS TO THE VOICES THAT ARE CRYING IN THE LANDTHE VOICES
OF PAIN AND SORROW THAT YOU WILL NOT HEAR BUT THAT SOME DAY WILL BE
HEARD  AND SO I SAY

BUT AT THIS POINT H  H  JONES AND PHILIP WARD  WHO HAD ALREADY RISEN
FROM THEIR CHAIRS  LED THE BISHOP OFF THE PLATFORM  WHILE THE AUDIENCE
SAT BREATHLESS AND SHOCKED 

ERNEST LAUGHED HARSHLY AND SAVAGELY WHEN HE HAD GAINED THE STREET  HIS
LAUGHTER JARRED UPON ME  MY HEART SEEMED READY TO BURST WITH SUPPRESSED
TEARS 

HE HAS DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE  ERNEST CRIED  THE MANHOOD AND THE
DEEPHIDDEN  TENDER NATURE OF THEIR BISHOP BURST OUT  AND HIS CHRISTIAN
AUDIENCE  THAT LOVED HIM  CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS CRAZY DID YOU SEE THEM
LEADING HIM SO SOLICITOUSLY FROM THE PLATFORM THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
LAUGHTER IN HELL AT THE SPECTACLE 

NEVERTHELESS  IT WILL MAKE A GREAT IMPRESSION  WHAT THE BISHOP DID AND
SAID TONIGHT  I SAID 

THINK SO ERNEST QUERIED MOCKINGLY 

IT WILL MAKE A SENSATION  I ASSERTED  DIDNT YOU SEE THE REPORTERS
SCRIBBLING LIKE MAD WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING

NOT A LINE OF WHICH WILL APPEAR IN TOMORROWS PAPERS 

I CANT BELIEVE IT  I CRIED 

JUST WAIT AND SEE  WAS THE ANSWER  NOT A LINE  NOT A THOUGHT THAT HE
UTTERED  THE DAILY PRESS THE DAILY SUPPRESSAGE

BUT THE REPORTERS  I OBJECTED  I SAW THEM 

NOT A WORD THAT HE UTTERED WILL SEE PRINT  YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THE
EDITORS  THEY DRAW THEIR SALARIES FOR THE POLICY THEY MAINTAIN  THEIR
POLICY IS TO PRINT NOTHING THAT IS A VITAL MENACE TO THE ESTABLISHED 
THE BISHOPS UTTERANCE WAS A VIOLENT ASSAULT UPON THE ESTABLISHED
MORALITY  IT WAS HERESY  THEY LED HIM FROM THE PLATFORM TO PREVENT HIM
FROM UTTERING MORE HERESY  THE NEWSPAPERS WILL PURGE HIS HERESY IN THE
OBLIVION OF SILENCE  THE PRESS OF THE UNITED STATES IT IS A PARASITIC
GROWTH THAT BATTENS ON THE CAPITALIST CLASS  ITS FUNCTION IS TO SERVE
THE ESTABLISHED BY MOULDING PUBLIC OPINION  AND RIGHT WELL IT SERVES IT 

LET ME PROPHESY  TOMORROWS PAPERS WILL MERELY MENTION THAT THE BISHOP
IS IN POOR HEALTH  THAT HE HAS BEEN WORKING TOO HARD  AND THAT HE BROKE
DOWN LAST NIGHT  THE NEXT MENTION  SOME DAYS HENCE  WILL BE TO THE
EFFECT THAT HE IS SUFFERING FROM NERVOUS PROSTRATION AND HAS BEEN GIVEN
A VACATION BY HIS GRATEFUL FLOCK  AFTER THAT  ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL
HAPPEN  EITHER THE BISHOP WILL SEE THE ERROR OF HIS WAY AND RETURN FROM
HIS VACATION A WELL MAN IN WHOSE EYES THERE ARE NO MORE VISIONS  OR ELSE
HE WILL PERSIST IN HIS MADNESS  AND THEN YOU MAY EXPECT TO SEE IN THE
PAPERS  COUCHED PATHETICALLY AND TENDERLY  THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS
INSANITY  AFTER THAT HE WILL BE LEFT TO GIBBER HIS VISIONS TO PADDED
WALLS 

NOW THERE YOU GO TOO FAR I CRIED OUT 

IN THE EYES OF SOCIETY IT WILL TRULY BE INSANITY  HE REPLIED  WHAT
HONEST MAN  WHO IS NOT INSANE  WOULD TAKE LOST WOMEN AND THIEVES INTO
HIS HOUSE TO DWELL WITH HIM SISTERLY AND BROTHERLY TRUE  CHRIST DIED
BETWEEN TWO THIEVES  BUT THAT IS ANOTHER STORY  INSANITY THE MENTAL
PROCESSES OF THE MAN WITH WHOM ONE DISAGREES  ARE ALWAYS WRONG 
THEREFORE THE MIND OF THE MAN IS WRONG  WHERE IS THE LINE BETWEEN
WRONG MIND AND INSANE MIND IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANY SANE MAN CAN
RADICALLY DISAGREE WITH ONES MOST SANE CONCLUSIONS 

THERE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF IT IN THIS EVENINGS PAPER  MARY MCKENNA
LIVES SOUTH OF MARKET STREET  SHE IS A POOR BUT HONEST WOMAN  SHE IS
ALSO PATRIOTIC  BUT SHE HAS ERRONEOUS IDEAS CONCERNING THE AMERICAN FLAG
AND THE PROTECTION IT IS SUPPOSED TO SYMBOLIZE  AND HERES WHAT HAPPENED
TO HER  HER HUSBAND HAD AN ACCIDENT AND WAS LAID UP IN HOSPITAL THREE
MONTHS  IN SPITE OF TAKING IN WASHING  SHE GOT BEHIND IN HER RENT 
YESTERDAY THEY EVICTED HER  BUT FIRST  SHE HOISTED AN AMERICAN FLAG  AND
FROM UNDER ITS FOLDS SHE ANNOUNCED THAT BY VIRTUE OF ITS PROTECTION THEY
COULD NOT TURN HER OUT ON TO THE COLD STREET  WHAT WAS DONE SHE WAS
ARRESTED AND ARRAIGNED FOR INSANITY  TODAY SHE WAS EXAMINED BY THE
REGULAR INSANITY EXPERTS  SHE WAS FOUND INSANE  SHE WAS CONSIGNED TO THE
NAPA ASYLUM 

BUT THAT IS FARFETCHED  I OBJECTED  SUPPOSE I SHOULD DISAGREE WITH
EVERYBODY ABOUT THE LITERARY STYLE OF A BOOK  THEY WOULDNT SEND ME TO
AN ASYLUM FOR THAT 

VERY TRUE  HE REPLIED  BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD
CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY  THEREIN LIES THE DIFFERENCE  THE
DIVERGENCE OF OPINION ON THE PARTS OF MARY MCKENNA AND THE BISHOP DO
MENACE SOCIETY  WHAT IF ALL THE POOR PEOPLE SHOULD REFUSE TO PAY RENT
AND SHELTER THEMSELVES UNDER THE AMERICAN FLAG LANDLORDISM WOULD GO
CRUMBLING  THE BISHOPS VIEWS ARE JUST AS PERILOUS TO SOCIETY  ERGO  TO
THE ASYLUM WITH HIM 

BUT STILL I REFUSED TO BELIEVE 

WAIT AND SEE  ERNEST SAID  AND I WAITED 

NEXT MORNING I SENT OUT FOR ALL THE PAPERS  SO FAR ERNEST WAS RIGHT  NOT
A WORD THAT BISHOP MOREHOUSE HAD UTTERED WAS IN PRINT  MENTION WAS MADE
IN ONE OR TWO OF THE PAPERS THAT HE HAD BEEN OVERCOME BY HIS FEELINGS 
YET THE PLATITUDES OF THE SPEAKERS THAT FOLLOWED HIM WERE REPORTED AT
LENGTH 

SEVERAL DAYS LATER THE BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY
ON A VACATION TO RECOVER FROM THE EFFECTS OF OVERWORK  SO FAR SO GOOD 
BUT THERE HAD BEEN NO HINT OF INSANITY  NOR EVEN OF NERVOUS COLLAPSE 
LITTLE DID I DREAM THE TERRIBLE ROAD THE BISHOP WAS DESTINED TO
TRAVELTHE GETHSEMANE AND CRUCIFIXION THAT ERNEST HAD PONDERED ABOUT 



CHAPTER VIII

THE MACHINE BREAKERS


IT WAS JUST BEFORE ERNEST RAN FOR CONGRESS  ON THE SOCIALIST TICKET 
THAT FATHER GAVE WHAT HE PRIVATELY CALLED HIS PROFIT AND LOSS DINNER 
ERNEST CALLED IT THE DINNER OF THE MACHINE BREAKERS  IN POINT OF FACT 
IT WAS MERELY A DINNER FOR BUSINESS MENSMALL BUSINESS MEN  OF
COURSE  I DOUBT IF ONE OF THEM WAS INTERESTED IN ANY BUSINESS THE TOTAL
CAPITALIZATION OF WHICH EXCEEDED A COUPLE OF HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS 
THEY WERE TRULY REPRESENTATIVE MIDDLECLASS BUSINESS MEN 

THERE WAS OWEN  OF SILVERBERG  OWEN  COMPANYA LARGE GROCERY FIRM WITH
SEVERAL BRANCH STORES  WE BOUGHT OUR GROCERIES FROM THEM  THERE WERE
BOTH PARTNERS OF THE BIG DRUG FIRM OF KOWALT  WASHBURN  AND MR 
ASMUNSEN  THE OWNER OF A LARGE GRANITE QUARRY IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY 
AND THERE WERE MANY SIMILAR MEN  OWNERS OR PARTOWNERS IN SMALL
FACTORIES  SMALL BUSINESSES AND SMALL INDUSTRIESSMALL CAPITALISTS  IN
SHORT 

THEY WERE SHREWDFACED  INTERESTING MEN  AND THEY TALKED WITH SIMPLICITY
AND CLEARNESS  THEIR UNANIMOUS COMPLAINT WAS AGAINST THE CORPORATIONS
AND TRUSTS  THEIR CREED WAS  BUST THE TRUSTS  ALL OPPRESSION
ORIGINATED IN THE TRUSTS  AND ONE AND ALL TOLD THE SAME TALE OF WOE 
THEY ADVOCATED GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF SUCH TRUSTS AS THE RAILROADS
AND TELEGRAPHS  AND EXCESSIVE INCOME TAXES  GRADUATED WITH FEROCITY 
TO DESTROY LARGE ACCUMULATIONS  LIKEWISE THEY ADVOCATED  AS A CURE FOR
LOCAL ILLS  MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP OF SUCH PUBLIC UTILITIES AS WATER  GAS 
TELEPHONES  AND STREET RAILWAYS 

ESPECIALLY INTERESTING WAS MR  ASMUNSENS NARRATIVE OF HIS TRIBULATIONS
AS A QUARRY OWNER  HE CONFESSED THAT HE NEVER MADE ANY PROFITS OUT OF
HIS QUARRY  AND THIS  IN SPITE OF THE ENORMOUS VOLUME OF BUSINESS
THAT HAD BEEN CAUSED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF SAN FRANCISCO BY THE BIG
EARTHQUAKE  FOR SIX YEARS THE REBUILDING OF SAN FRANCISCO HAD BEEN GOING
ON  AND HIS BUSINESS HAD QUADRUPLED AND OCTUPLED  AND YET HE WAS NO
BETTER OFF 

THE RAILROAD KNOWS MY BUSINESS JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN I DO  HE
SAID  IT KNOWS MY OPERATING EXPENSES TO A CENT  AND IT KNOWS THE TERMS
OF MY CONTRACTS  HOW IT KNOWS THESE THINGS I CAN ONLY GUESS  IT MUST
HAVE SPIES IN MY EMPLOY  AND IT MUST HAVE ACCESS TO THE PARTIES TO ALL
MY CONTRACTS  FOR LOOK YOU  WHEN I PLACE A BIG CONTRACT  THE TERMS
OF WHICH FAVOR ME A GOODLY PROFIT  THE FREIGHT RATE FROM MY QUARRY TO
MARKET IS PROMPTLY RAISED  NO EXPLANATION IS MADE  THE RAILROAD GETS MY
PROFIT  UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE NEVER SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE
RAILROAD TO RECONSIDER ITS RAISE  ON THE OTHER HAND  WHEN THERE HAVE
BEEN ACCIDENTS  INCREASED EXPENSES OF OPERATING  OR CONTRACTS WITH LESS
PROFITABLE TERMS  I HAVE ALWAYS SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE RAILROAD TO
LOWER ITS RATE  WHAT IS THE RESULT LARGE OR SMALL  THE RAILROAD ALWAYS
GETS MY PROFITS 

WHAT REMAINS TO YOU OVER AND ABOVE  ERNEST INTERRUPTED TO ASK  WOULD
ROUGHLY BE THE EQUIVALENT OF YOUR SALARY AS A MANAGER DID THE RAILROAD
OWN THE QUARRY 

THE VERY THING  MR  ASMUNSEN REPLIED  ONLY A SHORT TIME AGO I HAD MY
BOOKS GONE THROUGH FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS  I DISCOVERED THAT FOR
THOSE TEN YEARS MY GAIN WAS JUST EQUIVALENT TO A MANAGERS SALARY  THE
RAILROAD MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE OWNED MY QUARRY AND HIRED ME TO RUN
IT 

BUT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE  ERNEST LAUGHED THE RAILROAD WOULD HAVE HAD
TO ASSUME ALL THE RISK WHICH YOU SO OBLIGINGLY ASSUMED FOR IT 

VERY TRUE  MR  ASMUNSEN ANSWERED SADLY 

HAVING LET THEM HAVE THEY SAY  ERNEST BEGAN ASKING QUESTIONS RIGHT AND
LEFT  HE BEGAN WITH MR  OWEN 

YOU STARTED A BRANCH STORE HERE IN BERKELEY ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO

YES  MR  OWEN ANSWERED 

AND SINCE THEN IVE NOTICED THAT THREE LITTLE CORNER GROCERIES HAVE
GONE OUT OF BUSINESS  WAS YOUR BRANCH STORE THE CAUSE OF IT

MR  OWEN AFFIRMED WITH A COMPLACENT SMILE  THEY HAD NO CHANCE AGAINST
US 

WHY NOT

WE HAD GREATER CAPITAL  WITH A LARGE BUSINESS THERE IS ALWAYS LESS
WASTE AND GREATER EFFICIENCY 

AND YOUR BRANCH STORE ABSORBED THE PROFITS OF THE THREE SMALL ONES  I
SEE  BUT TELL ME  WHAT BECAME OF THE OWNERS OF THE THREE STORES

ONE IS DRIVING A DELIVERY WAGON FOR US  I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE OTHER TWO 

ERNEST TURNED ABRUPTLY ON MR  KOWALT 

YOU SELL A GREAT DEAL AT CUTRATES  WHAT HAVE BECOME OF THE OWNERS OF
THE SMALL DRUG STORES THAT YOU FORCED TO THE WALL

      A LOWERING OF SELLING PRICE TO COST  AND EVEN TO LESS THAN
     COST  THUS  A LARGE COMPANY COULD SELL AT A LOSS FOR A
     LONGER PERIOD THAN A SMALL COMPANY  AND SO DRIVE THE SMALL
     COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS   A COMMON DEVICE OF COMPETITION 

ONE OF THEM  MR  HAASFURTHER  HAS CHARGE NOW OF OUR PRESCRIPTION
DEPARTMENT  WAS THE ANSWER 

AND YOU ABSORBED THE PROFITS THEY HAD BEEN MAKING

SURELY  THAT IS WHAT WE ARE IN BUSINESS FOR 

AND YOU ERNEST SAID SUDDENLY TO MR  ASMUNSEN  YOU ARE DISGUSTED
BECAUSE THE RAILROAD HAS ABSORBED YOUR PROFITS

MR  ASMUNSEN NODDED 

WHAT YOU WANT IS TO MAKE PROFITS YOURSELF

AGAIN MR  ASMUNSEN NODDED 

OUT OF OTHERS

THERE WAS NO ANSWER 

OUT OF OTHERS ERNEST INSISTED 

THAT IS THE WAY PROFITS ARE MADE  MR  ASMUNSEN REPLIED CURTLY 

THEN THE BUSINESS GAME IS TO MAKE PROFITS OUT OF OTHERS  AND TO PREVENT
OTHERS FROM MAKING PROFITS OUT OF YOU  THATS IT  ISNT IT

ERNEST HAD TO REPEAT HIS QUESTION BEFORE MR  ASMUNSEN GAVE AN ANSWER 
AND THEN HE SAID 

YES  THATS IT  EXCEPT THAT WE DO NOT OBJECT TO THE OTHERS MAKING
PROFITS SO LONG AS THEY ARE NOT EXTORTIONATE 

BY EXTORTIONATE YOU MEAN LARGE YET YOU DO NOT OBJECT TO MAKING LARGE
PROFITS YOURSELF       SURELY NOT

AND MR  ASMUNSEN AMIABLY CONFESSED TO THE WEAKNESS  THERE WAS ONE OTHER
MAN WHO WAS QUIZZED BY ERNEST AT THIS JUNCTURE  A MR  CALVIN  WHO HAD
ONCE BEEN A GREAT DAIRYOWNER 

SOME TIME AGO YOU WERE FIGHTING THE MILK TRUST  ERNEST SAID TO HIM
AND NOW YOU ARE IN GRANGE POLITICS  HOW DID IT HAPPEN

      MANY EFFORTS WERE MADE DURING THIS PERIOD TO ORGANIZE THE
     PERISHING FARMER CLASS INTO A POLITICAL PARTY  THE AIM OF
     WHICH WAS DESTROY THE TRUSTS AND CORPORATIONS BY DRASTIC
     LEGISLATION   ALL SUCH ATTEMPTS ENDED IN FAILURE 

OH  I HAVENT QUIT THE FIGHT  MR  CALVIN ANSWERED  AND HE LOOKED
BELLIGERENT ENOUGH  IM FIGHTING THE TRUST ON THE ONLY FIELD WHERE IT
IS POSSIBLE TO FIGHTTHE POLITICAL FIELD  LET ME SHOW YOU  A FEW YEARS
AGO WE DAIRYMEN HAD EVERYTHING OUR OWN WAY 

BUT YOU COMPETED AMONG YOURSELVES ERNEST INTERRUPTED 

YES  THAT WAS WHAT KEPT THE PROFITS DOWN  WE DID TRY TO ORGANIZE  BUT
INDEPENDENT DAIRYMEN ALWAYS BROKE THROUGH US  THEN CAME THE MILK TRUST 

FINANCED BY SURPLUS CAPITAL FROM STANDARD OIL  ERNEST SAID 

      THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL GREAT TRUSTALMOST A GENERATION IN
     ADVANCE OF THE REST 

YES  MR  CALVIN ACKNOWLEDGED  BUT WE DID NOT KNOW IT AT THE TIME 
ITS AGENTS APPROACHED US WITH A CLUB  COME IN AND BE FAT  WAS THEIR
PROPOSITION  OR STAY OUT AND STARVE  MOST OF US CAME IN  THOSE THAT
DIDNT  STARVED  OH  IT PAID US       AT FIRST  MILK WAS RAISED A CENT A
QUART  ONEQUARTER OF THIS CENT CAME TO US  THREEQUARTERS OF IT WENT TO
THE TRUST  THEN MILK WAS RAISED ANOTHER CENT  ONLY WE DIDNT GET ANY
OF THAT CENT  OUR COMPLAINTS WERE USELESS  THE TRUST WAS IN CONTROL  WE
DISCOVERED THAT WE WERE PAWNS  FINALLY  THE ADDITIONAL QUARTER OF A CENT
WAS DENIED US  THEN THE TRUST BEGAN TO SQUEEZE US OUT  WHAT COULD WE DO
WE WERE SQUEEZED OUT  THERE WERE NO DAIRYMEN  ONLY A MILK TRUST 

BUT WITH MILK TWO CENTS HIGHER  I SHOULD THINK YOU COULD HAVE
COMPETED  ERNEST SUGGESTED SLYLY 

SO WE THOUGHT  WE TRIED IT  MR  CALVIN PAUSED A MOMENT  IT BROKE US 
THE TRUST COULD PUT MILK UPON THE MARKET MORE CHEAPLY THAN WE  IT COULD
SELL STILL AT A SLIGHT PROFIT WHEN WE WERE SELLING AT ACTUAL LOSS 
I DROPPED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THAT VENTURE  MOST OF US WENT
BANKRUPT  THE DAIRYMEN WERE WIPED OUT OF EXISTENCE 

      BANKRUPTCYA PECULIAR INSTITUTION THAT ENABLED AN
     INDIVIDUAL  WHO HAD FAILED IN COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY  TO
     FOREGO PAYING HIS DEBTS  THE EFFECT WAS TO AMELIORATE THE
     TOO SAVAGE CONDITIONS OF THE FANGANDCLAW SOCIAL STRUGGLE 

SO THE TRUST TOOK YOUR PROFITS AWAY FROM YOU  ERNEST SAID  AND YOUVE
GONE INTO POLITICS IN ORDER TO LEGISLATE THE TRUST OUT OF EXISTENCE AND
GET THE PROFITS BACK

MR  CALVINS FACE LIGHTED UP  THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I SAY IN MY
SPEECHES TO THE FARMERS  THATS OUR WHOLE IDEA IN A NUTSHELL 

AND YET THE TRUST PRODUCES MILK MORE CHEAPLY THAN COULD THE INDEPENDENT
DAIRYMEN ERNEST QUERIED 

WHY SHOULDNT IT  WITH THE SPLENDID ORGANIZATION AND NEW MACHINERY ITS
LARGE CAPITAL MAKES POSSIBLE

THERE IS NO DISCUSSION  ERNEST ANSWERED  IT CERTAINLY SHOULD  AND 
FURTHERMORE  IT DOES 

MR  CALVIN HERE LAUNCHED OUT INTO A POLITICAL SPEECH IN EXPOSITION OF
HIS VIEWS  HE WAS WARMLY FOLLOWED BY A NUMBER OF THE OTHERS  AND THE CRY
OF ALL WAS TO DESTROY THE TRUSTS 

POOR SIMPLE FOLK  ERNEST SAID TO ME IN AN UNDERTONE  THEY SEE CLEARLY
AS FAR AS THEY SEE  BUT THEY SEE ONLY TO THE ENDS OF THEIR NOSES 

A LITTLE LATER HE GOT THE FLOOR AGAIN  AND IN HIS CHARACTERISTIC WAY
CONTROLLED IT FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING 

I HAVE LISTENED CAREFULLY TO ALL OF YOU  HE BEGAN  AND I SEE PLAINLY
THAT YOU PLAY THE BUSINESS GAME IN THE ORTHODOX FASHION  LIFE SUMS
ITSELF UP TO YOU IN PROFITS  YOU HAVE A FIRM AND ABIDING BELIEF THAT
YOU WERE CREATED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF MAKING PROFITS  ONLY THERE IS A
HITCH  IN THE MIDST OF YOUR OWN PROFITMAKING ALONG COMES THE TRUST
AND TAKES YOUR PROFITS AWAY FROM YOU  THIS IS A DILEMMA THAT INTERFERES
SOMEHOW WITH THE AIM OF CREATION  AND THE ONLY WAY OUT  AS IT SEEMS TO
YOU  IS TO DESTROY THAT WHICH TAKES FROM YOU YOUR PROFITS 

I HAVE LISTENED CAREFULLY  AND THERE IS ONLY ONE NAME THAT WILL
EPITOMIZE YOU  I SHALL CALL YOU THAT NAME  YOU ARE MACHINEBREAKERS  DO
YOU KNOW WHAT A MACHINEBREAKER IS LET ME TELL YOU  IN THE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY  IN ENGLAND  MEN AND WOMEN WOVE CLOTH ON HANDLOOMS IN THEIR OWN
COTTAGES  IT WAS A SLOW  CLUMSY  AND COSTLY WAY OF WEAVING CLOTH 
THIS COTTAGE SYSTEM OF MANUFACTURE  ALONG CAME THE STEAMENGINE AND
LABORSAVING MACHINERY  A THOUSAND LOOMS ASSEMBLED IN A LARGE FACTORY 
AND DRIVEN BY A CENTRAL ENGINE WOVE CLOTH VASTLY MORE CHEAPLY THAN
COULD THE COTTAGE WEAVERS ON THEIR HANDLOOMS  HERE IN THE FACTORY WAS
COMBINATION  AND BEFORE IT COMPETITION FADED AWAY  THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO
HAD WORKED THE HANDLOOMS FOR THEMSELVES NOW WENT INTO THE FACTORIES
AND WORKED THE MACHINELOOMS  NOT FOR THEMSELVES  BUT FOR THE CAPITALIST
OWNERS  FURTHERMORE  LITTLE CHILDREN WENT TO WORK ON THE MACHINELOOMS 
AT LOWER WAGES  AND DISPLACED THE MEN  THIS MADE HARD TIMES FOR THE MEN 
THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING FELL  THEY STARVED  AND THEY SAID IT WAS
ALL THE FAULT OF THE MACHINES  THEREFORE  THEY PROCEEDED TO BREAK THE
MACHINES  THEY DID NOT SUCCEED  AND THEY WERE VERY STUPID 

YET YOU HAVE NOT LEARNED THEIR LESSON  HERE ARE YOU  A CENTURY AND A
HALF LATER  TRYING TO BREAK MACHINES  BY YOUR OWN CONFESSION THE TRUST
MACHINES DO THE WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE CHEAPLY THAN YOU CAN 
THAT IS WHY YOU CANNOT COMPETE WITH THEM  AND YET YOU WOULD BREAK THOSE
MACHINES  YOU ARE EVEN MORE STUPID THAN THE STUPID WORKMEN OF ENGLAND 
AND WHILE YOU MAUNDER ABOUT RESTORING COMPETITION  THE TRUSTS GO ON
DESTROYING YOU 

ONE AND ALL YOU TELL THE SAME STORY THE PASSING AWAY OF COMPETITION
AND THE COMING ON OF COMBINATION  YOU  MR  OWEN  DESTROYED COMPETITION
HERE IN BERKELEY WHEN YOUR BRANCH STORE DROVE THE THREE SMALL GROCERIES
OUT OF BUSINESS  YOUR COMBINATION WAS MORE EFFECTIVE  YET YOU FEEL THE
PRESSURE OF OTHER COMBINATIONS ON YOU  THE TRUST COMBINATIONS  AND YOU
CRY OUT  IT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT A TRUST  IF YOU WERE A GROCERY TRUST
FOR THE WHOLE UNITED STATES  YOU WOULD BE SINGING ANOTHER SONG  AND THE
SONG WOULD BE  BLESSED ARE THE TRUSTS  AND YET AGAIN  NOT ONLY IS YOUR
SMALL COMBINATION NOT A TRUST  BUT YOU ARE AWARE YOURSELF OF ITS LACK
OF STRENGTH  YOU ARE BEGINNING TO DIVINE YOUR OWN END  YOU FEEL
YOURSELF AND YOUR BRANCH STORES A PAWN IN THE GAME  YOU SEE THE POWERFUL
INTERESTS RISING AND GROWING MORE POWERFUL DAY BY DAY YOU FEEL THEIR
MAILED HANDS DESCENDING UPON YOUR PROFITS AND TAKING A PINCH HERE AND
A PINCH THERETHE RAILROAD TRUST  THE OIL TRUST  THE STEEL TRUST  THE
COAL TRUST AND YOU KNOW THAT IN THE END THEY WILL DESTROY YOU  TAKE
AWAY FROM YOU THE LAST PER CENT OF YOUR LITTLE PROFITS 

YOU  SIR  ARE A POOR GAMESTER  WHEN YOU SQUEEZED OUT THE THREE SMALL
GROCERIES HERE IN BERKELEY BY VIRTUE OF YOUR SUPERIOR COMBINATION  YOU
SWELLED OUT YOUR CHEST  TALKED ABOUT EFFICIENCY AND ENTERPRISE  AND SENT
YOUR WIFE TO EUROPE ON THE PROFITS YOU HAD GAINED BY EATING UP THE THREE
SMALL GROCERIES  IT IS DOG EAT DOG  AND YOU ATE THEM UP  BUT  ON THE
OTHER HAND  YOU ARE BEING EATEN UP IN TURN BY THE BIGGER DOGS  WHEREFORE
YOU SQUEAL  AND WHAT I SAY TO YOU IS TRUE OF ALL OF YOU AT THIS TABLE 
YOU ARE ALL SQUEALING  YOU ARE ALL PLAYING THE LOSING GAME  AND YOU ARE
ALL SQUEALING ABOUT IT 

BUT WHEN YOU SQUEAL YOU DONT STATE THE SITUATION FLATLY  AS I HAVE
STATED IT  YOU DONT SAY THAT YOU LIKE TO SQUEEZE PROFITS OUT OF OTHERS 
AND THAT YOU ARE MAKING ALL THE ROW BECAUSE OTHERS ARE SQUEEZING YOUR
PROFITS OUT OF YOU  NO  YOU ARE TOO CUNNING FOR THAT  YOU SAY SOMETHING
ELSE  YOU MAKE SMALLCAPITALIST POLITICAL SPEECHES SUCH AS MR  CALVIN
MADE  WHAT DID HE SAY HERE ARE A FEW OF HIS PHRASES I CAUGHT  OUR
ORIGINAL PRINCIPLES ARE ALL RIGHT  WHAT THIS COUNTRY REQUIRES IS A
RETURN TO FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN METHODSFREE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL  THE
SPIRIT OF LIBERTY IN WHICH THIS NATION WAS BORN  LET US RETURN TO THE
PRINCIPLES OF OUR FOREFATHERS 

WHEN HE SAYS FREE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL  HE MEANS FREE OPPORTUNITY TO
SQUEEZE PROFITS  WHICH FREEDOM OF OPPORTUNITY IS NOW DENIED HIM BY THE
GREAT TRUSTS  AND THE ABSURD THING ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU HAVE REPEATED
THESE PHRASES SO OFTEN THAT YOU BELIEVE THEM  YOU WANT OPPORTUNITY
TO PLUNDER YOUR FELLOWMEN IN YOUR OWN SMALL WAY  BUT YOU HYPNOTIZE
YOURSELVES INTO THINKING YOU WANT FREEDOM  YOU ARE PIGGISH AND
ACQUISITIVE  BUT THE MAGIC OF YOUR PHRASES LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT YOU
ARE PATRIOTIC  YOUR DESIRE FOR PROFITS  WHICH IS SHEER SELFISHNESS  YOU
METAMORPHOSE INTO ALTRUISTIC SOLICITUDE FOR SUFFERING HUMANITY  COME
ON NOW  RIGHT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES  AND BE HONEST FOR ONCE  LOOK THE
MATTER IN THE FACE AND STATE IT IN DIRECT TERMS 

THERE WERE FLUSHED AND ANGRY FACES AT THE TABLE  AND WITHAL A MEASURE
OF AWE  THEY WERE A LITTLE FRIGHTENED AT THIS SMOOTHFACED YOUNG FELLOW 
AND THE SWING AND SMASH OF HIS WORDS  AND HIS DREADFUL TRAIT OF CALLING
A SPADE A SPADE  MR  CALVIN PROMPTLY REPLIED 

AND WHY NOT HE DEMANDED  WHY CAN WE NOT RETURN TO WAYS OF OUR
FATHERS WHEN THIS REPUBLIC WAS FOUNDED YOU HAVE SPOKEN MUCH TRUTH  MR 
EVERHARD  UNPALATABLE THOUGH IT HAS BEEN  BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET
US SPEAK OUT  LET US THROW OFF ALL DISGUISE AND ACCEPT THE TRUTH AS MR 
EVERHARD HAS FLATLY STATED IT  IT IS TRUE THAT WE SMALLER CAPITALISTS
ARE AFTER PROFITS  AND THAT THE TRUSTS ARE TAKING OUR PROFITS AWAY FROM
US  IT IS TRUE THAT WE WANT TO DESTROY THE TRUSTS IN ORDER THAT OUR
PROFITS MAY REMAIN TO US  AND WHY CAN WE NOT DO IT WHY NOT I SAY  WHY
NOT

AH  NOW WE COME TO THE GIST OF THE MATTER  ERNEST SAID WITH A PLEASED
EXPRESSION  ILL TRY TO TELL YOU WHY NOT  THOUGH THE TELLING WILL BE
RATHER HARD  YOU SEE  YOU FELLOWS HAVE STUDIED BUSINESS  IN A SMALL WAY 
BUT YOU HAVE NOT STUDIED SOCIAL EVOLUTION AT ALL  YOU ARE IN THE
MIDST OF A TRANSITION STAGE NOW IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION  BUT YOU DO NOT
UNDERSTAND IT  AND THATS WHAT CAUSES ALL THE CONFUSION  WHY CANNOT YOU
RETURN BECAUSE YOU CANT  YOU CAN NO MORE MAKE WATER RUN UP HILL THAN
CAN YOU CAUSE THE TIDE OF ECONOMIC EVOLUTION TO FLOW BACK IN ITS CHANNEL
ALONG THE WAY IT CAME  JOSHUA MADE THE SUN STAND STILL UPON GIBEON  BUT
YOU WOULD OUTDO JOSHUA  YOU WOULD MAKE THE SUN GO BACKWARD IN THE SKY 
YOU WOULD HAVE TIME RETRACE ITS STEPS FROM NOON TO MORNING 

IN THE FACE OF LABORSAVING MACHINERY  OF ORGANIZED PRODUCTION  OF THE
INCREASED EFFICIENCY OF COMBINATION  YOU WOULD SET THE ECONOMIC SUN
BACK A WHOLE GENERATION OR SO TO THE TIME WHEN THERE WERE NO GREAT
CAPITALISTS  NO GREAT MACHINERY  NO RAILROADSA TIME WHEN A HOST OF
LITTLE CAPITALISTS WARRED WITH EACH OTHER IN ECONOMIC ANARCHY  AND WHEN
PRODUCTION WAS PRIMITIVE  WASTEFUL  UNORGANIZED  AND COSTLY  BELIEVE ME 
JOSHUAS TASK WAS EASIER  AND HE HAD JEHOVAH TO HELP HIM  BUT GOD HAS
FORSAKEN YOU SMALL CAPITALISTS  THE SUN OF THE SMALL CAPITALISTS IS
SETTING  IT WILL NEVER RISE AGAIN  NOR IS IT IN YOUR POWER EVEN TO MAKE
IT STAND STILL  YOU ARE PERISHING  AND YOU ARE DOOMED TO PERISH UTTERLY
FROM THE FACE OF SOCIETY 

THIS IS THE FIAT OF EVOLUTION  IT IS THE WORD OF GOD  COMBINATION IS
STRONGER THAN COMPETITION  PRIMITIVE MAN WAS A PUNY CREATURE HIDING IN
THE CREVICES OF THE ROCKS  HE COMBINED AND MADE WAR UPON HIS CARNIVOROUS
ENEMIES  THEY WERE COMPETITIVE BEASTS  PRIMITIVE MAN WAS A COMBINATIVE
BEAST  AND BECAUSE OF IT HE ROSE TO PRIMACY OVER ALL THE ANIMALS  AND
MAN HAS BEEN ACHIEVING GREATER AND GREATER COMBINATIONS EVER SINCE  IT
IS COMBINATION VERSUS COMPETITION  A THOUSAND CENTURIES LONG STRUGGLE 
IN WHICH COMPETITION HAS ALWAYS BEEN WORSTED  WHOSO ENLISTS ON THE SIDE
OF COMPETITION PERISHES 

BUT THE TRUSTS THEMSELVES AROSE OUT OF COMPETITION  MR  CALVIN
INTERRUPTED 

VERY TRUE  ERNEST ANSWERED  AND THE TRUSTS THEMSELVES DESTROYED
COMPETITION  THAT  BY YOUR OWN WORD  IS WHY YOU ARE NO LONGER IN THE
DAIRY BUSINESS 

THE FIRST LAUGHTER OF THE EVENING WENT AROUND THE TABLE  AND EVEN MR 
CALVIN JOINED IN THE LAUGH AGAINST HIMSELF 

AND NOW  WHILE WE ARE ON THE TRUSTS  ERNEST WENT ON  LET US SETTLE
A FEW THINGS  I SHALL MAKE CERTAIN STATEMENTS  AND IF YOU DISAGREE
WITH THEM  SPEAK UP  SILENCE WILL MEAN AGREEMENT  IS IT NOT TRUE THAT
A MACHINELOOM WILL WEAVE MORE CLOTH AND WEAVE MORE CHEAPLY THAN A
HANDLOOM HE PAUSED  BUT NOBODY SPOKE UP  IS IT NOT THEN HIGHLY
IRRATIONAL TO BREAK THE MACHINELOOM AND GO BACK TO THE CLUMSY AND MORE
COSTLY HANDLOOM METHOD OF WEAVING HEADS NODDED IN ACQUIESCENCE  IS
IT NOT TRUE THAT THAT KNOWN AS A TRUST PRODUCES MORE EFFICIENTLY AND
CHEAPLY THAN CAN A THOUSAND COMPETING SMALL CONCERNS STILL NO ONE
OBJECTED  THEN IS IT NOT IRRATIONAL TO DESTROY THAT CHEAP AND EFFICIENT
COMBINATION

NO ONE ANSWERED FOR A LONG TIME  THEN MR  KOWALT SPOKE 

WHAT ARE WE TO DO  THEN HE DEMANDED  TO DESTROY THE TRUSTS IS THE
ONLY WAY WE CAN SEE TO ESCAPE THEIR DOMINATION 

ERNEST WAS ALL FIRE AND ALIVENESS ON THE INSTANT 

ILL SHOW YOU ANOTHER WAY HE CRIED  LET US NOT DESTROY THOSE
WONDERFUL MACHINES THAT PRODUCE EFFICIENTLY AND CHEAPLY  LET US CONTROL
THEM  LET US PROFIT BY THEIR EFFICIENCY AND CHEAPNESS  LET US RUN THEM
FOR OURSELVES  LET US OUST THE PRESENT OWNERS OF THE WONDERFUL MACHINES 
AND LET US OWN THE WONDERFUL MACHINES OURSELVES  THAT  GENTLEMEN  IS
SOCIALISM  A GREATER COMBINATION THAN THE TRUSTS  A GREATER ECONOMIC AND
SOCIAL COMBINATION THAN ANY THAT HAS AS YET APPEARED ON THE PLANET  IT
IS IN LINE WITH EVOLUTION  WE MEET COMBINATION WITH GREATER COMBINATION 
IT IS THE WINNING SIDE  COME ON OVER WITH US SOCIALISTS AND PLAY ON THE
WINNING SIDE 

HERE AROSE DISSENT  THERE WAS A SHAKING OF HEADS  AND MUTTERINGS AROSE 

ALL RIGHT  THEN  YOU PREFER TO BE ANACHRONISMS  ERNEST LAUGHED  YOU
PREFER TO PLAY ATAVISTIC ROLES  YOU ARE DOOMED TO PERISH AS ALL ATAVISMS
PERISH  HAVE YOU EVER ASKED WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU WHEN GREATER
COMBINATIONS THAN EVEN THE PRESENT TRUSTS ARISE HAVE YOU EVER
CONSIDERED WHERE YOU WILL STAND WHEN THE GREAT TRUSTS THEMSELVES COMBINE
INTO THE COMBINATION OF COMBINATIONSINTO THE SOCIAL  ECONOMIC  AND
POLITICAL TRUST

HE TURNED ABRUPTLY AND IRRELEVANTLY UPON MR  CALVIN 

TELL ME  ERNEST SAID  IF THIS IS NOT TRUE  YOU ARE COMPELLED TO FORM
A NEW POLITICAL PARTY BECAUSE THE OLD PARTIES ARE IN THE HANDS OF THE
TRUSTS  THE CHIEF OBSTACLE TO YOUR GRANGE PROPAGANDA IS THE TRUSTS 
BEHIND EVERY OBSTACLE YOU ENCOUNTER  EVERY BLOW THAT SMITES YOU  EVERY
DEFEAT THAT YOU RECEIVE  IS THE HAND OF THE TRUSTS  IS THIS NOT SO TELL
ME 

MR  CALVIN SAT IN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE 

GO AHEAD  ERNEST ENCOURAGED 

IT IS TRUE  MR  CALVIN CONFESSED  WE CAPTURED THE STATE LEGISLATURE
OF OREGON AND PUT THROUGH SPLENDID PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION  AND IT WAS
VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR  WHO WAS A CREATURE OF THE TRUSTS  WE ELECTED A
GOVERNOR OF COLORADO  AND THE LEGISLATURE REFUSED TO PERMIT HIM TO TAKE
OFFICE  TWICE WE HAVE PASSED A NATIONAL INCOME TAX  AND EACH TIME THE
SUPREME COURT SMASHED IT AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL  THE COURTS ARE IN THE
HANDS OF THE TRUSTS  WE  THE PEOPLE  DO NOT PAY OUR JUDGES SUFFICIENTLY 
BUT THERE WILL COME A TIME

WHEN THE COMBINATION OF THE TRUSTS WILL CONTROL ALL LEGISLATION  WHEN
THE COMBINATION OF THE TRUSTS WILL ITSELF BE THE GOVERNMENT  ERNEST
INTERRUPTED 

NEVER NEVER WERE THE CRIES THAT AROSE  EVERYBODY WAS EXCITED AND
BELLIGERENT 

TELL ME  ERNEST DEMANDED  WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN SUCH A TIME COMES

WE WILL RISE IN OUR STRENGTH MR  ASMUNSEN CRIED  AND MANY VOICES
BACKED HIS DECISION 

THAT WILL BE CIVIL WAR  ERNEST WARNED THEM 

SO BE IT  CIVIL WAR  WAS MR  ASMUNSENS ANSWER  WITH THE CRIES OF ALL
THE MEN AT THE TABLE BEHIND HIM  WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE DEEDS OF OUR
FOREFATHERS  FOR OUR LIBERTIES WE ARE READY TO FIGHT AND DIE 

ERNEST SMILED 

DO NOT FORGET  HE SAID  THAT WE HAD TACITLY AGREED THAT LIBERTY IN
YOUR CASE  GENTLEMEN  MEANS LIBERTY TO SQUEEZE PROFITS OUT OF OTHERS 

THE TABLE WAS ANGRY  NOW  FIGHTING ANGRY BUT ERNEST CONTROLLED THE
TUMULT AND MADE HIMSELF HEARD 

ONE MORE QUESTION  WHEN YOU RISE IN YOUR STRENGTH  REMEMBER  THE REASON
FOR YOUR RISING WILL BE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS IN THE HANDS OF THE
TRUSTS  THEREFORE  AGAINST YOUR STRENGTH THE GOVERNMENT WILL TURN THE
REGULAR ARMY  THE NAVY  THE MILITIA  THE POLICEIN SHORT  THE WHOLE
ORGANIZED WAR MACHINERY OF THE UNITED STATES  WHERE WILL YOUR STRENGTH
BE THEN

DISMAY SAT ON THEIR FACES  AND BEFORE THEY COULD RECOVER  ERNEST STRUCK
AGAIN 

DO YOU REMEMBER  NOT SO LONG AGO  WHEN OUR REGULAR ARMY WAS ONLY FIFTY
THOUSAND YEAR BY YEAR IT HAS BEEN INCREASED UNTIL TODAY IT IS THREE
HUNDRED THOUSAND 

AGAIN HE STRUCK 

NOR IS THAT ALL  WHILE YOU DILIGENTLY PURSUED THAT FAVORITE PHANTOM
OF YOURS  CALLED PROFITS  AND MORALIZED ABOUT THAT FAVORITE FETICH OF
YOURS  CALLED COMPETITION  EVEN GREATER AND MORE DIREFUL THINGS HAVE
BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY COMBINATION  THERE IS THE MILITIA 

IT IS OUR STRENGTH CRIED MR  KOWALT  WITH IT WE WOULD REPEL THE
INVASION OF THE REGULAR ARMY 

YOU WOULD GO INTO THE MILITIA YOURSELF  WAS ERNESTS RETORT  AND
BE SENT TO MAINE  OR FLORIDA  OR THE PHILIPPINES  OR ANYWHERE ELSE 
TO DROWN IN BLOOD YOUR OWN COMRADES CIVILWARRING FOR THEIR LIBERTIES 
WHILE FROM KANSAS  OR WISCONSIN  OR ANY OTHER STATE  YOUR OWN COMRADES
WOULD GO INTO THE MILITIA AND COME HERE TO CALIFORNIA TO DROWN IN BLOOD
YOUR OWN CIVILWARRING 

NOW THEY WERE REALLY SHOCKED  AND THEY SAT WORDLESS  UNTIL MR  OWEN
MURMURED 

WE WOULD NOT GO INTO THE MILITIA  THAT WOULD SETTLE IT  WE WOULD NOT BE
SO FOOLISH 

ERNEST LAUGHED OUTRIGHT 

YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE COMBINATION THAT HAS BEEN EFFECTED  YOU COULD
NOT HELP YOURSELF  YOU WOULD BE DRAFTED INTO THE MILITIA 

THERE IS SUCH A THING AS CIVIL LAW  MR  OWEN INSISTED 

NOT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SUSPENDS CIVIL LAW  IN THAT DAY WHEN YOU
SPEAK OF RISING IN YOUR STRENGTH  YOUR STRENGTH WOULD BE TURNED AGAINST
YOURSELF  INTO THE MILITIA YOU WOULD GO  WILLYNILLY  HABEAS CORPUS  I
HEARD SOME ONE MUTTER JUST NOW  INSTEAD OF HABEAS CORPUS YOU WOULD GET
POST MORTEMS  IF YOU REFUSED TO GO INTO THE MILITIA  OR TO OBEY AFTER
YOU WERE IN  YOU WOULD BE TRIED BY DRUMHEAD COURT MARTIAL AND SHOT DOWN
LIKE DOGS  IT IS THE LAW 

IT IS NOT THE LAW MR  CALVIN ASSERTED POSITIVELY  THERE IS NO SUCH
LAW  YOUNG MAN  YOU HAVE DREAMED ALL THIS  WHY  YOU SPOKE OF SENDING THE
MILITIA TO THE PHILIPPINES  THAT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL  THE CONSTITUTION
ESPECIALLY STATES THAT THE MILITIA CANNOT BE SENT OUT OF THE COUNTRY 

WHATS THE CONSTITUTION GOT TO DO WITH IT ERNEST DEMANDED  THE
COURTS INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION  AND THE COURTS  AS MR  ASMUNSEN
AGREED  ARE THE CREATURES OF THE TRUSTS  BESIDES  IT IS AS I HAVE SAID 
THE LAW  IT HAS BEEN THE LAW FOR YEARS  FOR NINE YEARS  GENTLEMEN 

THAT WE CAN BE DRAFTED INTO THE MILITIA MR  CALVIN ASKED
INCREDULOUSLY  THAT THEY CAN SHOOT US BY DRUMHEAD COURT MARTIAL IF WE
REFUSE

YES  ERNEST ANSWERED  PRECISELY THAT 

HOW IS IT THAT WE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS LAW MY FATHER ASKED  AND I
COULD SEE THAT IT WAS LIKEWISE NEW TO HIM 

FOR TWO REASONS  ERNEST SAID  FIRST  THERE HAS BEEN NO NEED TO
ENFORCE IT  IF THERE HAD  YOUD HAVE HEARD OF IT SOON ENOUGH  AND
SECONDLY  THE LAW WAS RUSHED THROUGH CONGRESS AND THE SENATE SECRETLY 
WITH PRACTICALLY NO DISCUSSION  OF COURSE  THE NEWSPAPERS MADE NO
MENTION OF IT  BUT WE SOCIALISTS KNEW ABOUT IT  WE PUBLISHED IT IN OUR
PAPERS  BUT YOU NEVER READ OUR PAPERS 

I STILL INSIST YOU ARE DREAMING  MR  CALVIN SAID STUBBORNLY  THE
COUNTRY WOULD NEVER HAVE PERMITTED IT 

BUT THE COUNTRY DID PERMIT IT  ERNEST REPLIED  AND AS FOR MY
DREAMING HE PUT HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET AND DREW OUT A SMALL
PAMPHLETTELL ME IF THIS LOOKS LIKE DREAMSTUFF 

HE OPENED IT AND BEGAN TO READ 

SECTION ONE  BE IT ENACTED  AND SO FORTH AND SO FORTH  THAT THE
MILITIA SHALL CONSIST OF EVERY ABLEBODIED MALE CITIZEN OF THE
RESPECTIVE STATES  TERRITORIES  AND DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  WHO IS MORE
THAN EIGHTEEN AND LESS THAN FORTYFIVE YEARS OF AGE 

SECTION SEVEN  THAT ANY OFFICER OR ENLISTED MANREMEMBER SECTION
ONE  GENTLEMEN  YOU ARE ALL ENLISTED MENTHAT ANY ENLISTED MAN OF THE
MILITIA WHO SHALL REFUSE OR NEGLECT TO PRESENT HIMSELF TO SUCH MUSTERING
OFFICER UPON BEING CALLED FORTH AS HEREIN PRESCRIBED  SHALL BE SUBJECT
TO TRIAL BY COURT MARTIAL  AND SHALL BE PUNISHED AS SUCH COURT MARTIAL
SHALL DIRECT 

SECTION EIGHT  THAT COURTS MARTIAL  FOR THE TRIAL OF OFFICERS OR MEN
OF THE MILITIA  SHALL BE COMPOSED OF MILITIA OFFICERS ONLY 

SECTION NINE  THAT THE MILITIA  WHEN CALLED INTO THE ACTUAL SERVICE
OF THE UNITED STATES  SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME RULES AND ARTICLES OF
WAR AS THE REGULAR TROOPS OF THE UNITED STATES 

THERE YOU ARE GENTLEMEN  AMERICAN CITIZENS  AND FELLOWMILITIAMEN  NINE
YEARS AGO WE SOCIALISTS THOUGHT THAT LAW WAS AIMED AGAINST LABOR  BUT IT
WOULD SEEM THAT IT WAS AIMED AGAINST YOU  TOO  CONGRESSMAN WILEY  IN THE
BRIEF DISCUSSION THAT WAS PERMITTED  SAID THAT THE BILL PROVIDED FOR
A RESERVE FORCE TO TAKE THE MOB BY THE THROATYOURE THE MOB 
GENTLEMENAND PROTECT AT ALL HAZARDS LIFE  LIBERTY  AND PROPERTY  AND
IN THE TIME TO COME  WHEN YOU RISE IN YOUR STRENGTH  REMEMBER THAT YOU
WILL BE RISING AGAINST THE PROPERTY OF THE TRUSTS  AND THE LIBERTY OF
THE TRUSTS  ACCORDING TO THE LAW  TO SQUEEZE YOU  YOUR TEETH ARE PULLED 
GENTLEMEN  YOUR CLAWS ARE TRIMMED  IN THE DAY YOU RISE IN YOUR STRENGTH 
TOOTHLESS AND CLAWLESS  YOU WILL BE AS HARMLESS AS ANY ARMY OF CLAMS 

I DONT BELIEVE IT KOWALT CRIED  THERE IS NO SUCH LAW  IT IS A
CANARD GOT UP BY YOU SOCIALISTS 

THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON JULY  
  WAS THE REPLY  IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF
OHIO  IT WAS RUSHED THROUGH  IT WAS PASSED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE SENATE
ON JANUARY     AND JUST SEVEN DAYS AFTERWARD WAS APPROVED BY THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

      EVERHARD WAS RIGHT IN THE ESSENTIAL PARTICULARS  THOUGH
     HIS DATE OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL IS IN ERROR   THE
     BILL WAS INTRODUCED ON JUNE   AND NOT ON JULY    THE
     CONGRESSIONAL RECORD IS HERE IN ARDIS  AND A REFERENCE TO IT
     SHOWS MENTION OF THE BILL ON THE FOLLOWING DATES  JUNE  
     DECEMBER       AND     AND JANUARY  AND  
        THE IGNORANCE EVIDENCED BY THE BUSINESS MEN AT THE
     DINNER WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL   VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE
     EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW   E   UNTERMANN  A REVOLUTIONIST  IN
     JULY    PUBLISHED A PAMPHLET AT GIRARD  KANSAS  ON THE
     MILITIA BILL   THIS PAMPHLET HAD A SMALL CIRCULATION AMONG
     WORKINGMEN BUT ALREADY HAD THE SEGREGATION OF CLASSES
     PROCEEDED SO FAR  THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS NEVER
     HEARD OF THE PAMPHLET AT ALL  AND SO REMAINED IN IGNORANCE
     OF THE LAW 



CHAPTER IX

THE MATHEMATICS OF A DREAM


IN THE MIDST OF THE CONSTERNATION HIS REVELATION HAD PRODUCED  ERNEST
BEGAN AGAIN TO SPEAK 

YOU HAVE SAID  A DOZEN OF YOU TONIGHT  THAT SOCIALISM IS IMPOSSIBLE 
YOU HAVE ASSERTED THE IMPOSSIBLE  NOW LET ME DEMONSTRATE THE INEVITABLE 
NOT ONLY IS IT INEVITABLE THAT YOU SMALL CAPITALISTS SHALL PASS AWAY 
BUT IT IS INEVITABLE THAT THE LARGE CAPITALISTS  AND THE TRUSTS ALSO 
SHALL PASS AWAY  REMEMBER  THE TIDE OF EVOLUTION NEVER FLOWS BACKWARD 
IT FLOWS ON AND ON  AND IT FLOWS FROM COMPETITION TO COMBINATION  AND
FROM LITTLE COMBINATION TO LARGE COMBINATION  AND FROM LARGE COMBINATION
TO COLOSSAL COMBINATION  AND IT FLOWS ON TO SOCIALISM  WHICH IS THE MOST
COLOSSAL COMBINATION OF ALL 

YOU TELL ME THAT I DREAM  VERY GOOD  ILL GIVE YOU THE MATHEMATICS
OF MY DREAM AND HERE  IN ADVANCE  I CHALLENGE YOU TO SHOW THAT
MY MATHEMATICS ARE WRONG  I SHALL DEVELOP THE INEVITABILITY OF
THE BREAKDOWN OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM  AND I SHALL DEMONSTRATE
MATHEMATICALLY WHY IT MUST BREAK DOWN  HERE GOES  AND BEAR WITH ME IF AT
FIRST I SEEM IRRELEVANT 

LET US  FIRST OF ALL  INVESTIGATE A PARTICULAR INDUSTRIAL PROCESS  AND
WHENEVER I STATE SOMETHING WITH WHICH YOU DISAGREE  PLEASE INTERRUPT
ME  HERE IS A SHOE FACTORY  THIS FACTORY TAKES LEATHER AND MAKES IT INTO
SHOES  HERE IS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF LEATHER  IT GOES THROUGH
THE FACTORY AND COMES OUT IN THE FORM OF SHOES  WORTH  LET US SAY  TWO
HUNDRED DOLLARS  WHAT HAS HAPPENED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS HAS BEEN ADDED
TO THE VALUE OF THE LEATHER  HOW WAS IT ADDED LET US SEE 

CAPITAL AND LABOR ADDED THIS VALUE OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS  CAPITAL
FURNISHED THE FACTORY  THE MACHINES  AND PAID ALL THE EXPENSES  LABOR
FURNISHED LABOR  BY THE JOINT EFFORT OF CAPITAL AND LABOR ONE HUNDRED
DOLLARS OF VALUE WAS ADDED  ARE YOU ALL AGREED SO FAR

HEADS NODDED AROUND THE TABLE IN AFFIRMATION 

LABOR AND CAPITAL HAVING PRODUCED THIS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS  NOW PROCEED
TO DIVIDE IT  THE STATISTICS OF THIS DIVISION ARE FRACTIONAL SO LET
US  FOR THE SAKE OF CONVENIENCE  MAKE THEM ROUGHLY APPROXIMATE  CAPITAL
TAKES FIFTY DOLLARS AS ITS SHARE  AND LABOR GETS IN WAGES FIFTY DOLLARS
AS ITS SHARE  WE WILL NOT ENTER INTO THE SQUABBLING OVER THE DIVISION 
NO MATTER HOW MUCH SQUABBLING TAKES PLACE  IN ONE PERCENTAGE OR ANOTHER
THE DIVISION IS ARRANGED  AND TAKE NOTICE HERE  THAT WHAT IS TRUE OF
THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRIAL PROCESS IS TRUE OF ALL INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES 
AM I RIGHT

      EVERHARD HERE CLEARLY DEVELOPS THE CAUSE OF ALL THE LABOR
     TROUBLES OF THAT TIME   IN THE DIVISION OF THE JOINTPRODUCT 
     CAPITAL WANTED ALL IT COULD GET  AND LABOR WANTED
     ALL IT COULD GET  THIS QUARREL OVER THE DIVISION WAS
     IRRECONCILABLE   SO LONG AS THE SYSTEM OF CAPITALISTIC
     PRODUCTION EXISTED  LABOR AND CAPITAL CONTINUED TO QUARREL
     OVER THE DIVISION OF THE JOINTPRODUCT   IT IS A LUDICROUS
     SPECTACLE TO US  BUT WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT WE HAVE SEVEN
     CENTURIES ADVANTAGE OVER THOSE THAT LIVED IN THAT TIME 

AGAIN THE WHOLE TABLE AGREED WITH ERNEST 

NOW  SUPPOSE LABOR  HAVING RECEIVED ITS FIFTY DOLLARS  WANTED TO BUY
BACK SHOES  IT COULD ONLY BUY BACK FIFTY DOLLARS WORTH  THATS CLEAR 
ISNT IT

AND NOW WE SHIFT FROM THIS PARTICULAR PROCESS TO THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL
INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES IN THE UNITED STATES  WHICH INCLUDES THE LEATHER
ITSELF  RAW MATERIAL  TRANSPORTATION  SELLING  EVERYTHING  WE WILL SAY 
FOR THE SAKE OF ROUND FIGURES  THAT THE TOTAL PRODUCTION OF WEALTH IN
THE UNITED STATES IS ONE YEAR IS FOUR BILLION DOLLARS  THEN LABOR HAS
RECEIVED IN WAGES  DURING THE SAME PERIOD  TWO BILLION DOLLARS  FOUR
BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN PRODUCED  HOW MUCH OF THIS CAN LABOR BUY
BACK TWO BILLIONS  THERE IS NO DISCUSSION OF THIS  I AM SURE  FOR THAT
MATTER  MY PERCENTAGES ARE MILD  BECAUSE OF A THOUSAND CAPITALISTIC
DEVICES  LABOR CANNOT BUY BACK EVEN HALF OF THE TOTAL PRODUCT 

BUT TO RETURN  WE WILL SAY LABOR BUYS BACK TWO BILLIONS  THEN IT STANDS
TO REASON THAT LABOR CAN CONSUME ONLY TWO BILLIONS  THERE ARE STILL TWO
BILLIONS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR  WHICH LABOR CANNOT BUY BACK AND CONSUME 

LABOR DOES NOT CONSUME ITS TWO BILLIONS  EVEN  MR  KOWALT SPOKE UP 
IF IT DID  IT WOULD NOT HAVE ANY DEPOSITS IN THE SAVINGS BANKS 

LABORS DEPOSITS IN THE SAVINGS BANKS ARE ONLY A SORT OF RESERVE FUND
THAT IS CONSUMED AS FAST AS IT ACCUMULATES  THESE DEPOSITS ARE SAVED
FOR OLD AGE  FOR SICKNESS AND ACCIDENT  AND FOR FUNERAL EXPENSES  THE
SAVINGS BANK DEPOSIT IS SIMPLY A PIECE OF THE LOAF PUT BACK ON THE SHELF
TO BE EATEN NEXT DAY  NO  LABOR CONSUMES ALL OF THE TOTAL PRODUCT THAT
ITS WAGES WILL BUY BACK 

TWO BILLIONS ARE LEFT TO CAPITAL  AFTER IT HAS PAID ITS EXPENSES  DOES
IT CONSUME THE REMAINDER DOES CAPITAL CONSUME ALL OF ITS TWO BILLIONS

ERNEST STOPPED AND PUT THE QUESTION POINT BLANK TO A NUMBER OF THE MEN 
THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS 

I DONT KNOW  ONE OF THEM FRANKLY SAID 

OF COURSE YOU DO  ERNEST WENT ON  STOP AND THINK A MOMENT  IF CAPITAL
CONSUMED ITS SHARE  THE SUM TOTAL OF CAPITAL COULD NOT INCREASE  IT
WOULD REMAIN CONSTANT  IF YOU WILL LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC HISTORY OF
THE UNITED STATES  YOU WILL SEE THAT THE SUM TOTAL OF CAPITAL HAS
CONTINUALLY INCREASED  THEREFORE CAPITAL DOES NOT CONSUME ITS SHARE  DO
YOU REMEMBER WHEN ENGLAND OWNED SO MUCH OF OUR RAILROAD BONDS AS THE
YEARS WENT BY  WE BOUGHT BACK THOSE BONDS  WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT
PART OF CAPITALS UNCONSUMED SHARE BOUGHT BACK THE BONDS  WHAT IS THE
MEANING OF THE FACT THAT TODAY THE CAPITALISTS OF THE UNITED STATES OWN
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MEXICAN BONDS  RUSSIAN
BONDS  ITALIAN BONDS  GRECIAN BONDS THE MEANING IS THAT THOSE HUNDREDS
AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS WERE PART OF CAPITALS SHARE WHICH CAPITAL
DID NOT CONSUME  FURTHERMORE  FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE CAPITALIST
SYSTEM  CAPITAL HAS NEVER CONSUMED ALL OF ITS SHARE 

AND NOW WE COME TO THE POINT  FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF WEALTH IS
PRODUCED IN ONE YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES  LABOR BUYS BACK AND CONSUMES
TWO BILLIONS  CAPITAL DOES NOT CONSUME THE REMAINING TWO BILLIONS  THERE
IS A LARGE BALANCE LEFT OVER UNCONSUMED  WHAT IS DONE WITH THIS BALANCE
WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH IT LABOR CANNOT CONSUME ANY OF IT  FOR LABOR
HAS ALREADY SPENT ALL ITS WAGES  CAPITAL WILL NOT CONSUME THIS BALANCE 
BECAUSE  ALREADY  ACCORDING TO ITS NATURE  IT HAS CONSUMED ALL IT CAN 
AND STILL REMAINS THE BALANCE  WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH IT WHAT IS DONE
WITH IT

IT IS SOLD ABROAD  MR  KOWALT VOLUNTEERED 

THE VERY THING  ERNEST AGREED  BECAUSE OF THIS BALANCE ARISES OUR
NEED FOR A FOREIGN MARKET  THIS IS SOLD ABROAD  IT HAS TO BE SOLD
ABROAD  THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF GETTING RID OF IT  AND THAT UNCONSUMED
SURPLUS  SOLD ABROAD  BECOMES WHAT WE CALL OUR FAVORABLE BALANCE OF
TRADE  ARE WE ALL AGREED SO FAR

SURELY IT IS A WASTE OF TIME TO ELABORATE THESE A B CS OF COMMERCE 
MR  CALVIN SAID TARTLY  WE ALL UNDERSTAND THEM 

AND IT IS BY THESE A B CS I HAVE SO CAREFULLY ELABORATED THAT I SHALL
CONFOUND YOU  ERNEST RETORTED  THERES THE BEAUTY OF IT  AND IM GOING
TO CONFOUND YOU WITH THEM RIGHT NOW  HERE GOES 

THE UNITED STATES IS A CAPITALIST COUNTRY THAT HAS DEVELOPED ITS
RESOURCES  ACCORDING TO ITS CAPITALIST SYSTEM OF INDUSTRY  IT HAS AN
UNCONSUMED SURPLUS THAT MUST BE GOT RID OF  AND THAT MUST BE GOT RID
OF ABROAD  WHAT IS TRUE OF THE UNITED STATES IS TRUE OF EVERY OTHER
CAPITALIST COUNTRY WITH DEVELOPED RESOURCES  EVERY ONE OF SUCH COUNTRIES
HAS AN UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  DONT FORGET THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY TRADED
WITH ONE ANOTHER  AND THAT THESE SURPLUSES YET REMAIN  LABOR IN ALL
THESE COUNTRIES HAS SPENT IT WAGES  AND CANNOT BUY ANY OF THE SURPLUSES 
CAPITAL IN ALL THESE COUNTRIES HAS ALREADY CONSUMED ALL IT IS ABLE
ACCORDING TO ITS NATURE  AND STILL REMAIN THE SURPLUSES  THEY CANNOT
DISPOSE OF THESE SURPLUSES TO ONE ANOTHER  HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET RID
OF THEM

      THEODORE ROOSEVELT  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A FEW
     YEARS PRIOR TO THIS TIME  MADE THE FOLLOWING PUBLIC
     DECLARATION  A MORE LIBERAL AND EXTENSIVE RECIPROCITY IN
     THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF COMMODITIES IS NECESSARY  SO THAT
     THE OVERPRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES CAN BE
     SATISFACTORILY DISPOSED OF TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES   OF
     COURSE  THIS OVERPRODUCTION HE MENTIONS WAS THE PROFITS OF
     THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM OVER AND BEYOND THE CONSUMING POWER OF
     THE CAPITALISTS   IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT SENATOR MARK
     HANNA SAID  THE PRODUCTION OF WEALTH IN THE UNITED STATES
     IS ONETHIRD LARGER ANNUALLY THAN ITS CONSUMPTION   ALSO A
     FELLOWSENATOR  CHAUNCEY DEPEW  SAID  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
     PRODUCE ANNUALLY TWO BILLIONS MORE WEALTH THAN THEY
     CONSUME 

SELL THEM TO COUNTRIES WITH UNDEVELOPED RESOURCES  MR  KOWALT
SUGGESTED 

THE VERY THING  YOU SEE  MY ARGUMENT IS SO CLEAR AND SIMPLE THAT
IN YOUR OWN MINDS YOU CARRY IT ON FOR ME  AND NOW FOR THE NEXT STEP 
SUPPOSE THE UNITED STATES DISPOSES OF ITS SURPLUS TO A COUNTRY WITH
UNDEVELOPED RESOURCES LIKE  SAY  BRAZIL  REMEMBER THIS SURPLUS IS OVER
AND ABOVE TRADE  WHICH ARTICLES OF TRADE HAVE BEEN CONSUMED  WHAT  THEN 
DOES THE UNITED STATES GET IN RETURN FROM BRAZIL

GOLD  SAID MR  KOWALT 

BUT THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH GOLD  AND NOT MUCH OF IT  IN THE WORLD 
ERNEST OBJECTED 

GOLD IN THE FORM OF SECURITIES AND BONDS AND SO FORTH  MR  KOWALT
AMENDED 

NOW YOUVE STRUCK IT  ERNEST SAID  FROM BRAZIL THE UNITED STATES  IN
RETURN FOR HER SURPLUS  GETS BONDS AND SECURITIES  AND WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN IT MEANS THAT THE UNITED STATES IS COMING TO OWN RAILROADS IN
BRAZIL  FACTORIES  MINES  AND LANDS IN BRAZIL  AND WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THAT IN TURN

MR  KOWALT PONDERED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD 

ILL TELL YOU  ERNEST CONTINUED  IT MEANS THAT THE RESOURCES OF
BRAZIL ARE BEING DEVELOPED  AND NOW  THE NEXT POINT  WHEN BRAZIL  UNDER
THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM  HAS DEVELOPED HER RESOURCES  SHE WILL HERSELF
HAVE AN UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  CAN SHE GET RID OF THIS SURPLUS TO THE
UNITED STATES NO  BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS HERSELF A SURPLUS  CAN
THE UNITED STATES DO WHAT SHE PREVIOUSLY DIDGET RID OF HER SURPLUS TO
BRAZIL NO  FOR BRAZIL NOW HAS A SURPLUS  TOO 

WHAT HAPPENS THE UNITED STATES AND BRAZIL MUST BOTH SEEK OUT OTHER
COUNTRIES WITH UNDEVELOPED RESOURCES  IN ORDER TO UNLOAD THE SURPLUSES
ON THEM  BUT BY THE VERY PROCESS OF UNLOADING THE SURPLUSES  THE
RESOURCES OF THOSE COUNTRIES ARE IN TURN DEVELOPED  SOON THEY HAVE
SURPLUSES  AND ARE SEEKING OTHER COUNTRIES ON WHICH TO UNLOAD  NOW 
GENTLEMEN  FOLLOW ME  THE PLANET IS ONLY SO LARGE  THERE ARE ONLY SO
MANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD  WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN EVERY COUNTRY IN
THE WORLD  DOWN TO THE SMALLEST AND LAST  WITH A SURPLUS IN ITS HANDS 
STANDS CONFRONTING EVERY OTHER COUNTRY WITH SURPLUSES IN THEIR HANDS

HE PAUSED AND REGARDED HIS LISTENERS  THE BEPUZZLEMENT IN THEIR FACES
WAS DELICIOUS  ALSO  THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES  OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS
ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT  THEY WERE SEEING IT
THEN  AS THEY SAT THERE  AND THEY WERE FRIGHTENED BY IT 

WE STARTED WITH A B C  MR  CALVIN  ERNEST SAID SLYLY  I HAVE NOW
GIVEN YOU THE REST OF THE ALPHABET  IT IS VERY SIMPLE  THAT IS THE
BEAUTY OF IT  YOU SURELY HAVE THE ANSWER FORTHCOMING  WHAT  THEN  WHEN
EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS AN UNCONSUMED SURPLUS WHERE WILL YOUR
CAPITALIST SYSTEM BE THEN

BUT MR  CALVIN SHOOK A TROUBLED HEAD  HE WAS OBVIOUSLY QUESTING BACK
THROUGH ERNESTS REASONING IN SEARCH OF AN ERROR 

LET ME BRIEFLY GO OVER THE GROUND WITH YOU AGAIN  ERNEST SAID  WE
BEGAN WITH A PARTICULAR INDUSTRIAL PROCESS  THE SHOE FACTORY  WE FOUND
THAT THE DIVISION OF THE JOINT PRODUCT THAT TOOK PLACE THERE WAS SIMILAR
TO THE DIVISION THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL INDUSTRIAL
PROCESSES  WE FOUND THAT LABOR COULD BUY BACK WITH ITS WAGES ONLY
SO MUCH OF THE PRODUCT  AND THAT CAPITAL DID NOT CONSUME ALL OF THE
REMAINDER OF THE PRODUCT  WE FOUND THAT WHEN LABOR HAD CONSUMED TO THE
FULL EXTENT OF ITS WAGES  AND WHEN CAPITAL HAD CONSUMED ALL IT WANTED 
THERE WAS STILL LEFT AN UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  WE AGREED THAT THIS SURPLUS
COULD ONLY BE DISPOSED OF ABROAD  WE AGREED  ALSO  THAT THE EFFECT
OF UNLOADING THIS SURPLUS ON ANOTHER COUNTRY WOULD BE TO DEVELOP THE
RESOURCES OF THAT COUNTRY  AND THAT IN A SHORT TIME THAT COUNTRY
WOULD HAVE AN UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  WE EXTENDED THIS PROCESS TO ALL THE
COUNTRIES ON THE PLANET  TILL EVERY COUNTRY WAS PRODUCING EVERY YEAR 
AND EVERY DAY  AN UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  WHICH IT COULD DISPOSE OF TO NO
OTHER COUNTRY  AND NOW I ASK YOU AGAIN  WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH
THOSE SURPLUSES

STILL NO ONE ANSWERED 

MR  CALVIN ERNEST QUERIED 

IT BEATS ME  MR  CALVIN CONFESSED 

I NEVER DREAMED OF SUCH A THING  MR  ASMUNSEN SAID  AND YET IT DOES
SEEM CLEAR AS PRINT 

IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER HEARD KARL MARXS DOCTRINE OF SURPLUS
VALUE ELABORATED  AND ERNEST HAD DONE IT SO SIMPLY THAT I  TOO  SAT
PUZZLED AND DUMBFOUNDED 

      KARL MARXTHE GREAT INTELLECTUAL HERO OF SOCIALISM   A
     GERMAN JEW OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY   A CONTEMPORARY OF
     JOHN STUART MILL  IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE TO US THAT WHOLE
     GENERATIONS SHOULD HAVE ELAPSED AFTER THE ENUNCIATION OF
     MARXS ECONOMIC DISCOVERIES  IN WHICH TIME HE WAS SNEERED AT
     BY THE WORLDS ACCEPTED THINKERS AND SCHOLARS   BECAUSE OF
     HIS DISCOVERIES HE WAS BANISHED FROM HIS NATIVE COUNTRY  AND
     HE DIED AN EXILE IN ENGLAND 

ILL TELL YOU A WAY TO GET RID OF THE SURPLUS  ERNEST SAID  THROW IT
INTO THE SEA  THROW EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH
OF SHOES AND WHEAT AND CLOTHING AND ALL THE COMMODITIES OF COMMERCE INTO
THE SEA  WONT THAT FIX IT

IT WILL CERTAINLY FIX IT  MR  CALVIN ANSWERED  BUT IT IS ABSURD FOR
YOU TO TALK THAT WAY 

ERNEST WAS UPON HIM LIKE A FLASH 

IS IT A BIT MORE ABSURD THAN WHAT YOU ADVOCATE  YOU MACHINEBREAKER 
RETURNING TO THE ANTEDILUVIAN WAYS OF YOUR FOREFATHERS WHAT DO YOU
PROPOSE IN ORDER TO GET RID OF THE SURPLUS YOU WOULD ESCAPE THE PROBLEM
OF THE SURPLUS BY NOT PRODUCING ANY SURPLUS  AND HOW DO YOU PROPOSE
TO AVOID PRODUCING A SURPLUS BY RETURNING TO A PRIMITIVE METHOD OF
PRODUCTION  SO CONFUSED AND DISORDERLY AND IRRATIONAL  SO WASTEFUL AND
COSTLY  THAT IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PRODUCE A SURPLUS 

MR  CALVIN SWALLOWED  THE POINT HAD BEEN DRIVEN HOME  HE SWALLOWED AGAIN
AND CLEARED HIS THROAT 

YOU ARE RIGHT  HE SAID  I STAND CONVICTED  IT IS ABSURD  BUT WEVE
GOT TO DO SOMETHING  IT IS A CASE OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR US OF THE MIDDLE
CLASS  WE REFUSE TO PERISH  WE ELECT TO BE ABSURD AND TO RETURN TO THE
TRULY CRUDE AND WASTEFUL METHODS OF OUR FOREFATHERS  WE WILL PUT BACK
INDUSTRY TO ITS PRETRUST STAGE  WE WILL BREAK THE MACHINES  AND WHAT
ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT

BUT YOU CANT BREAK THE MACHINES  ERNEST REPLIED  YOU CANNOT MAKE THE
TIDE OF EVOLUTION FLOW BACKWARD  OPPOSED TO YOU ARE TWO GREAT FORCES 
EACH OF WHICH IS MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU OF THE MIDDLE CLASS  THE LARGE
CAPITALISTS  THE TRUSTS  IN SHORT  WILL NOT LET YOU TURN BACK  THEY
DONT WANT THE MACHINES DESTROYED  AND GREATER THAN THE TRUSTS  AND
MORE POWERFUL  IS LABOR  IT WILL NOT LET YOU DESTROY THE MACHINES  THE
OWNERSHIP OF THE WORLD  ALONG WITH THE MACHINES  LIES BETWEEN THE
TRUSTS AND LABOR  THAT IS THE BATTLE ALIGNMENT  NEITHER SIDE WANTS
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE MACHINES  BUT EACH SIDE WANTS TO POSSESS THE
MACHINES  IN THIS BATTLE THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS NO PLACE  THE MIDDLE CLASS
IS A PYGMY BETWEEN TWO GIANTS  DONT YOU SEE  YOU POOR PERISHING MIDDLE
CLASS  YOU ARE CAUGHT BETWEEN THE UPPER AND NETHER MILLSTONES  AND EVEN
NOW HAS THE GRINDING BEGUN 

I HAVE DEMONSTRATED TO YOU MATHEMATICALLY THE INEVITABLE BREAKDOWN OF
THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM  WHEN EVERY COUNTRY STANDS WITH AN UNCONSUMED AND
UNSALABLE SURPLUS ON ITS HANDS  THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM WILL BREAK DOWN
UNDER THE TERRIFIC STRUCTURE OF PROFITS THAT IT ITSELF HAS REARED  AND
IN THAT DAY THERE WONT BE ANY DESTRUCTION OF THE MACHINES  THE STRUGGLE
THEN WILL BE FOR THE OWNERSHIP OF THE MACHINES  IF LABOR WINS  YOUR WAY
WILL BE EASY  THE UNITED STATES  AND THE WHOLE WORLD FOR THAT MATTER 
WILL ENTER UPON A NEW AND TREMENDOUS ERA  INSTEAD OF BEING CRUSHED BY
THE MACHINES  LIFE WILL BE MADE FAIRER  AND HAPPIER  AND NOBLER BY
THEM  YOU OF THE DESTROYED MIDDLE CLASS  ALONG WITH LABORTHERE WILL
BE NOTHING BUT LABOR THEN SO YOU  AND ALL THE REST OF LABOR  WILL
PARTICIPATE IN THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRODUCTS OF THE
WONDERFUL MACHINES  AND WE  ALL OF US  WILL MAKE NEW AND MORE WONDERFUL
MACHINES  AND THERE WONT BE ANY UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  BECAUSE THERE WONT
BE ANY PROFITS 

BUT SUPPOSE THE TRUSTS WIN IN THIS BATTLE OVER THE OWNERSHIP OF THE
MACHINES AND THE WORLD MR  KOWALT ASKED 

THEN  ERNEST ANSWERED  YOU  AND LABOR  AND ALL OF US  WILL BE CRUSHED
UNDER THE IRON HEEL OF A DESPOTISM AS RELENTLESS AND TERRIBLE AS ANY
DESPOTISM THAT HAS BLACKENED THE PAGES OF THE HISTORY OF MAN  THAT WILL
BE A GOOD NAME FOR THAT DESPOTISM  THE IRON HEEL 

      THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THAT NAME TO DESIGNATE THE
     OLIGARCHY 

THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE  AND EVERY MAN AT THE TABLE MEDITATED IN WAYS
UNWONTED AND PROFOUND 

BUT THIS SOCIALISM OF YOURS IS A DREAM  MR  CALVIN SAID AND REPEATED 
A DREAM 

ILL SHOW YOU SOMETHING THAT ISNT A DREAM  THEN  ERNEST ANSWERED 
AND THAT SOMETHING I SHALL CALL THE OLIGARCHY  YOU CALL IT THE
PLUTOCRACY  WE BOTH MEAN THE SAME THING  THE LARGE CAPITALISTS OR THE
TRUSTS  LET US SEE WHERE THE POWER LIES TODAY  AND IN ORDER TO DO SO 
LET US APPORTION SOCIETY INTO ITS CLASS DIVISIONS 

THERE ARE THREE BIG CLASSES IN SOCIETY  FIRST COMES THE PLUTOCRACY 
WHICH IS COMPOSED OF WEALTHY BANKERS  RAILWAY MAGNATES  CORPORATION
DIRECTORS  AND TRUST MAGNATES  SECOND  IS THE MIDDLE CLASS  YOUR CLASS 
GENTLEMEN  WHICH IS COMPOSED OF FARMERS  MERCHANTS  SMALL MANUFACTURERS 
AND PROFESSIONAL MEN  AND THIRD AND LAST COMES MY CLASS  THE
PROLETARIAT  WHICH IS COMPOSED OF THE WAGEWORKERS 

      THIS DIVISION OF SOCIETY MADE BY EVERHARD IS IN ACCORDANCE
     WITH THAT MADE BY LUCIEN SANIAL  ONE OF THE STATISTICAL
     AUTHORITIES OF THAT TIME   HIS CALCULATION OF THE MEMBERSHIP
     OF THESE DIVISIONS BY OCCUPATION  FROM THE UNITED STATES
     CENSUS OF   IS AS FOLLOWS  PLUTOCRATIC CLASS   
     MIDDLE CLASS     AND PROLETARIAT CLASS     

YOU CANNOT BUT GRANT THAT THE OWNERSHIP OF WEALTH CONSTITUTES ESSENTIAL
POWER IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY  HOW IS THIS WEALTH OWNED BY THESE
THREE CLASSES HERE ARE THE FIGURES  THE PLUTOCRACY OWNS SIXTYSEVEN
BILLIONS OF WEALTH  OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONS ENGAGED IN
OCCUPATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES  ONLY NINETENTHS OF ONE PER CENT ARE
FROM THE PLUTOCRACY  YET THE PLUTOCRACY OWNS SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE
TOTAL WEALTH  THE MIDDLE CLASS OWNS TWENTYFOUR BILLIONS  TWENTYNINE
PER CENT OF THOSE IN OCCUPATIONS ARE FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS  AND THEY OWN
TWENTYFIVE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL WEALTH  REMAINS THE PROLETARIAT  IT
OWNS FOUR BILLIONS  OF ALL PERSONS IN OCCUPATIONS  SEVENTY PER CENT
COME FROM THE PROLETARIAT AND THE PROLETARIAT OWNS FOUR PER CENT OF THE
TOTAL WEALTH  WHERE DOES THE POWER LIE  GENTLEMEN

FROM YOUR OWN FIGURES  WE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN
LABOR  MR  ASMUNSEN REMARKED 

CALLING US WEAK DOES NOT MAKE YOU STRONGER IN THE FACE OF THE STRENGTH
OF THE PLUTOCRACY  ERNEST RETORTED  AND FURTHERMORE  IM NOT DONE WITH
YOU  THERE IS A GREATER STRENGTH THAN WEALTH  AND IT IS GREATER BECAUSE
IT CANNOT BE TAKEN AWAY  OUR STRENGTH  THE STRENGTH OF THE PROLETARIAT 
IS IN OUR MUSCLES  IN OUR HANDS TO CAST BALLOTS  IN OUR FINGERS TO PULL
TRIGGERS  THIS STRENGTH WE CANNOT BE STRIPPED OF  IT IS THE PRIMITIVE
STRENGTH  IT IS THE STRENGTH THAT IS TO LIFE GERMANE  IT IS THE STRENGTH
THAT IS STRONGER THAN WEALTH  AND THAT WEALTH CANNOT TAKE AWAY 

BUT YOUR STRENGTH IS DETACHABLE  IT CAN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU  EVEN
NOW THE PLUTOCRACY IS TAKING IT AWAY FROM YOU  IN THE END IT WILL TAKE
IT ALL AWAY FROM YOU  AND THEN YOU WILL CEASE TO BE THE MIDDLE CLASS 
YOU WILL DESCEND TO US  YOU WILL BECOME PROLETARIANS  AND THE BEAUTY OF
IT IS THAT YOU WILL THEN ADD TO OUR STRENGTH  WE WILL HAIL YOU BROTHERS 
AND WE WILL FIGHT SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN THE CAUSE OF HUMANITY 

YOU SEE  LABOR HAS NOTHING CONCRETE OF WHICH TO BE DESPOILED  ITS
SHARE OF THE WEALTH OF THE COUNTRY CONSISTS OF CLOTHES AND HOUSEHOLD
FURNITURE  WITH HERE AND THERE  IN VERY RARE CASES  AN UNENCUMBERED
HOME  BUT YOU HAVE THE CONCRETE WEALTH  TWENTYFOUR BILLIONS OF IT  AND
THE PLUTOCRACY WILL TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU  OF COURSE  THERE IS THE LARGE
LIKELIHOOD THAT THE PROLETARIAT WILL TAKE IT AWAY FIRST  DONT YOU
SEE YOUR POSITION  GENTLEMEN THE MIDDLE CLASS IS A WOBBLY LITTLE LAMB
BETWEEN A LION AND A TIGER  IF ONE DOESNT GET YOU  THE OTHER WILL  AND
IF THE PLUTOCRACY GETS YOU FIRST  WHY ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME WHEN
THE PROLETARIAT GETS THE PLUTOCRACY 

EVEN YOUR PRESENT WEALTH IS NOT A TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR POWER  THE
STRENGTH OF YOUR WEALTH AT THIS MOMENT IS ONLY AN EMPTY SHELL  THAT IS
WHY YOU ARE CRYING OUT YOUR FEEBLE LITTLE BATTLECRY  RETURN TO THE
WAYS OF OUR FATHERS  YOU ARE AWARE OF YOUR IMPOTENCY  YOU KNOW THAT
YOUR STRENGTH IS AN EMPTY SHELL  AND ILL SHOW YOU THE EMPTINESS OF IT 

WHAT POWER HAVE THE FARMERS OVER FIFTY PER CENT ARE THRALLS BY VIRTUE
OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE MERELY TENANTS OR ARE MORTGAGED  AND ALL OF
THEM ARE THRALLS BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THE TRUSTS ALREADY OWN OR
CONTROL WHICH IS THE SAME THING ONLY BETTEROWN AND CONTROL ALL
THE MEANS OF MARKETING THE CROPS  SUCH AS COLD STORAGE  RAILROADS 
ELEVATORS  AND STEAMSHIP LINES  AND  FURTHERMORE  THE TRUSTS CONTROL
THE MARKETS  IN ALL THIS THE FARMERS ARE WITHOUT POWER  AS REGARDS THEIR
POLITICAL AND GOVERNMENTAL POWER  ILL TAKE THAT UP LATER  ALONG WITH
THE POLITICAL AND GOVERNMENTAL POWER OF THE WHOLE MIDDLE CLASS 

DAY BY DAY THE TRUSTS SQUEEZE OUT THE FARMERS AS THEY SQUEEZED OUT MR 
CALVIN AND THE REST OF THE DAIRYMEN  AND DAY BY DAY ARE THE MERCHANTS
SQUEEZED OUT IN THE SAME WAY  DO YOU REMEMBER HOW  IN SIX MONTHS  THE
TOBACCO TRUST SQUEEZED OUT OVER FOUR HUNDRED CIGAR STORES IN NEW YORK
CITY ALONE WHERE ARE THE OLDTIME OWNERS OF THE COAL FIELDS YOU KNOW
TODAY  WITHOUT MY TELLING YOU  THAT THE RAILROAD TRUST OWNS OR CONTROLS
THE ENTIRE ANTHRACITE AND BITUMINOUS COAL FIELDS  DOESNT THE STANDARD
OIL TRUST OWN A SCORE OF THE OCEAN LINES AND DOES IT NOT ALSO CONTROL
COPPER  TO SAY NOTHING OF RUNNING A SMELTER TRUST AS A LITTLE SIDE
ENTERPRISE THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES TONIGHT
LIGHTED BY THE COMPANIES OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY STANDARD OIL  AND IN
AS MANY CITIES ALL THE ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION URBAN  SUBURBAN  AND
INTERURBAN IS IN THE HANDS OF STANDARD OIL  THE SMALL CAPITALISTS WHO
WERE IN THESE THOUSANDS OF ENTERPRISES ARE GONE  YOU KNOW THAT  ITS THE
SAME WAY THAT YOU ARE GOING 

      STANDARD OIL AND ROCKEFELLERSEE UPCOMING FOOTNOTE 
     ROCKEFELLER BEGAN AS A MEMBER      

THE SMALL MANUFACTURER IS LIKE THE FARMER AND SMALL MANUFACTURERS
AND FARMERS TODAY ARE REDUCED  TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES  TO FEUDAL
TENURE  FOR THAT MATTER  THE PROFESSIONAL MEN AND THE ARTISTS ARE
AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT VILLEINS IN EVERYTHING BUT NAME  WHILE THE
POLITICIANS ARE HENCHMEN  WHY DO YOU  MR  CALVIN  WORK ALL YOUR NIGHTS
AND DAYS TO ORGANIZE THE FARMERS  ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE MIDDLE
CLASS  INTO A NEW POLITICAL PARTY BECAUSE THE POLITICIANS OF THE OLD
PARTIES WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR ATAVISTIC IDEAS AND WITH YOUR
ATAVISTIC IDEAS  THEY WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO BECAUSE THEY ARE WHAT I
SAID THEY ARE  HENCHMEN  RETAINERS OF THE PLUTOCRACY 

I SPOKE OF THE PROFESSIONAL MEN AND THE ARTISTS AS VILLEINS  WHAT ELSE
ARE THEY ONE AND ALL  THE PROFESSORS  THE PREACHERS  AND THE EDITORS 
HOLD THEIR JOBS BY SERVING THE PLUTOCRACY  AND THEIR SERVICE CONSISTS OF
PROPAGATING ONLY SUCH IDEAS AS ARE EITHER HARMLESS TO OR COMMENDATORY
OF THE PLUTOCRACY  WHENEVER THEY PROPAGATE IDEAS THAT MENACE THE
PLUTOCRACY  THEY LOSE THEIR JOBS  IN WHICH CASE  IF THEY HAVE NOT
PROVIDED FOR THE RAINY DAY  THEY DESCEND INTO THE PROLETARIAT AND EITHER
PERISH OR BECOME WORKINGCLASS AGITATORS  AND DONT FORGET THAT IT IS
THE PRESS  THE PULPIT  AND THE UNIVERSITY THAT MOULD PUBLIC OPINION  SET
THE THOUGHTPACE OF THE NATION  AS FOR THE ARTISTS  THEY MERELY PANDER
TO THE LITTLE LESS THAN IGNOBLE TASTES OF THE PLUTOCRACY 

BUT AFTER ALL  WEALTH IN ITSELF IS NOT THE REAL POWER IT IS THE MEANS
TO POWER  AND POWER IS GOVERNMENTAL  WHO CONTROLS THE GOVERNMENT TODAY
THE PROLETARIAT WITH ITS TWENTY MILLIONS ENGAGED IN OCCUPATIONS EVEN
YOU LAUGH AT THE IDEA  DOES THE MIDDLE CLASS  WITH ITS EIGHT MILLION
OCCUPIED MEMBERS NO MORE THAN THE PROLETARIAT  WHO  THEN  CONTROLS
THE GOVERNMENT THE PLUTOCRACY  WITH ITS PALTRY QUARTER OF A MILLION
OF OCCUPIED MEMBERS  BUT THIS QUARTER OF A MILLION DOES NOT CONTROL THE
GOVERNMENT  THOUGH IT RENDERS YEOMAN SERVICE  IT IS THE BRAIN OF THE
PLUTOCRACY THAT CONTROLS THE GOVERNMENT  AND THIS BRAIN CONSISTS OF
SEVEN SMALL AND POWERFUL GROUPS OF MEN  AND DO NOT FORGET THAT THESE
GROUPS ARE WORKING TODAY PRACTICALLY IN UNISON 

      EVEN AS LATE AS   IT WAS CONSIDERED THAT ELEVEN GROUPS
     DOMINATED THE COUNTRY  BUT THIS NUMBER WAS REDUCED BY THE
     AMALGAMATION OF THE FIVE RAILROAD GROUPS INTO A SUPREME
     COMBINATION OF ALL THE RAILROADS   THESE FIVE GROUPS SO
     AMALGAMATED  ALONG WITH THEIR FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL
     ALLIES  WERE  JAMES J  HILL WITH HIS CONTROL OF THE
     NORTHWEST  THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILWAY GROUP  SCHIFF
     FINANCIAL MANAGER  WITH BIG BANKING FIRMS OF PHILADELPHIA
     AND NEW YORK  HARRIMAN  WITH FRICK FOR COUNSEL AND ODELL
     AS POLITICAL LIEUTENANT  CONTROLLING THE CENTRAL
     CONTINENTAL  SOUTHWESTERN AND SOUTHERN PACIFIC COAST LINES
     OF TRANSPORTATION  THE GOULD FAMILY RAILWAY INTERESTS
     AND  MOORE  REID  AND LEEDS  KNOWN AS THE ROCK ISLAND
     CROWD   THESE STRONG OLIGARCHS AROSE OUT OF THE CONFLICT OF
     COMPETITION AND TRAVELLED THE INEVITABLE ROAD TOWARD
     COMBINATION 

LET ME POINT OUT THE POWER OF BUT ONE OF THEM  THE RAILROAD GROUP  IT
EMPLOYS FORTY THOUSAND LAWYERS TO DEFEAT THE PEOPLE IN THE COURTS  IT
ISSUES COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF FREE PASSES TO JUDGES  BANKERS  EDITORS 
MINISTERS  UNIVERSITY MEN  MEMBERS OF STATE LEGISLATURES  AND OF
CONGRESS  IT MAINTAINS LUXURIOUS LOBBIES AT EVERY STATE CAPITAL  AND
AT THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND IN ALL THE CITIES AND TOWNS OF THE LAND
IT EMPLOYS AN IMMENSE ARMY OF PETTIFOGGERS AND SMALL POLITICIANS WHOSE
BUSINESS IS TO ATTEND PRIMARIES  PACK CONVENTIONS  GET ON JURIES  BRIBE
JUDGES  AND IN EVERY WAY TO WORK FOR ITS INTERESTS 

      LOBBYA PECULIAR INSTITUTION FOR BRIBING  BULLDOZING  AND
     CORRUPTING THE LEGISLATORS WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT
     THE PEOPLES INTERESTS 

      A DECADE BEFORE THIS SPEECH OF EVERHARDS  THE NEW YORK
     BOARD OF TRADE ISSUED A REPORT FROM WHICH THE FOLLOWING IS
     QUOTED  THE RAILROADS CONTROL ABSOLUTELY THE LEGISLATURES
     OF A MAJORITY OF THE STATES OF THE UNION THEY MAKE AND
     UNMAKE UNITED STATES SENATORS  CONGRESSMEN  AND GOVERNORS 
     AND ARE PRACTICALLY DICTATORS OF THE GOVERNMENTAL POLICY OF
     THE UNITED STATES 

GENTLEMEN  I HAVE MERELY SKETCHED THE POWER OF ONE OF THE SEVEN GROUPS
THAT CONSTITUTE THE BRAIN OF THE PLUTOCRACY  YOUR TWENTYFOUR BILLIONS
OF WEALTH DOES NOT GIVE YOU TWENTYFIVE CENTS WORTH OF GOVERNMENTAL
POWER  IT IS AN EMPTY SHELL  AND SOON EVEN THE EMPTY SHELL WILL BE TAKEN
AWAY FROM YOU  THE PLUTOCRACY HAS ALL POWER IN ITS HANDS TODAY  IT
TODAY MAKES THE LAWS  FOR IT OWNS THE SENATE  CONGRESS  THE COURTS  AND
THE STATE LEGISLATURES  AND NOT ONLY THAT  BEHIND LAW MUST BE FORCE TO
EXECUTE THE LAW  TODAY THE PLUTOCRACY MAKES THE LAW  AND TO ENFORCE THE
LAW IT HAS AT ITS BECK AND CALL THE  POLICE  THE ARMY  THE NAVY  AND 
LASTLY  THE MILITIA  WHICH IS YOU  AND ME  AND ALL OF US 

      ROCKEFELLER BEGAN AS A MEMBER OF THE PROLETARIAT  AND
     THROUGH THRIFT AND CUNNING SUCCEEDED IN DEVELOPING THE FIRST
     PERFECT TRUST  NAMELY THAT KNOWN AS STANDARD OIL   WE CANNOT
     FORBEAR GIVING THE FOLLOWING REMARKABLE PAGE FROM THE
     HISTORY OF THE TIMES  TO SHOW HOW THE NEED FOR REINVESTMENT
     OF THE STANDARD OIL SURPLUS CRUSHED OUT SMALL CAPITALISTS
     AND HASTENED THE BREAKDOWN OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM   DAVID
     GRAHAM PHILLIPS WAS A RADICAL WRITER OF THE PERIOD  AND THE
     QUOTATION  BY HIM  IS TAKEN FROM A COPY OF THE SATURDAY
     EVENING POST  DATED OCTOBER    A D   THIS IS THE ONLY
     COPY OF THIS PUBLICATION THAT HAS COME DOWN TO US  AND YET 
     FROM ITS APPEARANCE AND CONTENT  WE CANNOT BUT CONCLUDE THAT
     IT WAS ONE OF THE POPULAR PERIODICALS WITH A LARGE
     CIRCULATION   THE QUOTATION HERE FOLLOWS 

     ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO ROCKEFELLERS INCOME WAS GIVEN AS
     THIRTY MILLIONS BY AN EXCELLENT AUTHORITY   HE HAD REACHED
     THE LIMIT OF PROFITABLE INVESTMENT OF PROFITS IN THE OIL
     INDUSTRY   HERE  THEN  WERE THESE ENORMOUS SUMS IN CASH
     POURING INMORE THAN    A MONTH FOR JOHN DAVISON
     ROCKEFELLER ALONE   THE PROBLEM OF REINVESTMENT BECAME MORE
     SERIOUS   IT BECAME A NIGHTMARE   THE OIL INCOME WAS
     SWELLING  SWELLING  AND THE NUMBER OF SOUND INVESTMENTS
     LIMITED  EVEN MORE LIMITED THAN IT IS NOW   IT WAS THROUGH
     NO SPECIAL EAGERNESS FOR MORE GAINS THAT THE ROCKEFELLERS
     BEGAN TO BRANCH OUT FROM OIL INTO OTHER THINGS   THEY WERE
     FORCED  SWEPT ON BY THIS INROLLING TIDE OF WEALTH WHICH
     THEIR MONOPOLY MAGNET IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED   THEY
     DEVELOPED A STAFF OF INVESTMENT SEEKERS AND INVESTIGATORS 
     IT IS SAID THAT THE CHIEF OF THIS STAFF HAS A SALARY OF
       A YEAR 

     THE FIRST CONSPICUOUS EXCURSION AND INCURSION OF THE
     ROCKEFELLERS WAS INTO THE RAILWAY FIELD   BY  THEY
     CONTROLLED ONEFIFTH OF THE RAILWAY MILEAGE OF THE COUNTRY 
     WHAT DO THEY OWN OR  THROUGH DOMINANT OWNERSHIP  CONTROL
     TODAY  THEY ARE POWERFUL IN ALL THE GREAT RAILWAYS OF NEW
     YORK  NORTH  EAST  AND WEST  EXCEPT ONE  WHERE THEIR SHARE
     IS ONLY A FEW MILLIONS   THEY ARE IN MOST OF THE GREAT
     RAILWAYS RADIATING FROM CHICAGO   THEY DOMINATE IN SEVERAL
     OF THE SYSTEMS THAT EXTEND TO THE PACIFIC   IT IS THEIR
     VOTES THAT MAKE MR  MORGAN SO POTENT  THOUGH  IT MAY BE
     ADDED  THEY NEED HIS BRAINS MORE THAN HE NEEDS THEIR VOTES
     AT PRESENT  AND THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO CONSTITUTES IN
     LARGE MEASURE THE COMMUNITY OF INTEREST 

     BUT RAILWAYS COULD NOT ALONE ABSORB RAPIDLY ENOUGH THOSE
     MIGHTY FLOODS OF GOLD   PRESENTLY JOHN D  ROCKEFELLERS
        A MONTH HAD INCREASED TO FOUR  TO FIVE  TO SIX
     MILLIONS A MONTH  TO    A YEAR   ILLUMINATING OIL
     WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT   THE REINVESTMENTS OF INCOME WERE
     ADDING THEIR MITE OF MANY ANNUAL MILLIONS 

     THE ROCKEFELLERS WENT INTO GAS AND ELECTRICITY WHEN THOSE
     INDUSTRIES HAD DEVELOPED TO THE SAFE INVESTMENT STAGE   AND
     NOW A LARGE PART OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MUST BEGIN TO ENRICH
     THE ROCKEFELLERS AS SOON AS THE SUN GOES DOWN  NO MATTER
     WHAT FORM OF ILLUMINANT THEY USE   THEY WENT INTO FARM
     MORTGAGES   IT IS SAID THAT WHEN PROSPERITY A FEW YEARS AGO
     ENABLED THE FARMERS TO RID THEMSELVES OF THEIR MORTGAGES 
     JOHN D  ROCKEFELLER WAS MOVED ALMOST TO TEARS EIGHT
     MILLIONS WHICH HE HAD THOUGHT TAKEN CARE OF FOR YEARS TO
     COME AT A GOOD INTEREST WERE SUDDENLY DUMPED UPON HIS
     DOORSTEP AND THERE SET UP ASQUAWKING FOR A NEW HOME   THIS
     UNEXPECTED ADDITION TO HIS WORRIMENTS IN FINDING PLACES FOR
     THE PROGENY OF HIS PETROLEUM AND THEIR PROGENY AND THEIR
     PROGENYS PROGENY WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE EQUANIMITY OF A MAN
     WITHOUT A DIGESTION       

     THE ROCKEFELLERS WENT INTO MINESIRON AND COAL AND COPPER
     AND LEAD INTO OTHER INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES INTO STREET
     RAILWAYS  INTO NATIONAL  STATE  AND MUNICIPAL BONDS INTO
     STEAMSHIPS AND STEAMBOATS AND TELEGRAPHY INTO REAL ESTATE 
     INTO SKYSCRAPERS AND RESIDENCES AND HOTELS AND BUSINESS
     BLOCKS INTO LIFE INSURANCE  INTO BANKING   THERE WAS SOON
     LITERALLY NO FIELD OF INDUSTRY WHERE THEIR MILLIONS WERE NOT
     AT WORK       

     THE ROCKEFELLER BANKTHE NATIONAL CITY BANKIS BY ITSELF
     FAR AND AWAY THE BIGGEST BANK IN THE UNITED STATES   IT IS
     EXCEEDED IN THE WORLD ONLY BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND THE
     BANK OF FRANCE   THE DEPOSITS AVERAGE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED
     MILLIONS A DAY AND IT DOMINATES THE CALL LOAN MARKET ON
     WALL STREET AND THE STOCK MARKET  BUT IT IS NOT ALONE IT IS
     THE HEAD OF THE ROCKEFELLER CHAIN OF BANKS  WHICH INCLUDES
     FOURTEEN BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES IN NEW YORK CITY  AND
     BANKS OF GREAT STRENGTH AND INFLUENCE IN EVERY LARGE MONEY
     CENTER IN THE COUNTRY 

     JOHN D  ROCKEFELLER OWNS STANDARD OIL STOCK WORTH BETWEEN
     FOUR AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLIONS AT THE MARKET QUOTATIONS   HE
     HAS A HUNDRED MILLIONS IN THE STEEL TRUST  ALMOST AS MUCH IN
     A SINGLE WESTERN RAILWAY SYSTEM  HALF AS MUCH IN A SECOND 
     AND SO ON AND ON AND ON UNTIL THE MIND WEARIES OF THE
     CATALOGUING   HIS INCOME LAST YEAR WAS ABOUT   
     IT IS DOUBTFUL IF THE INCOMES OF ALL THE ROTHSCHILDS
     TOGETHER MAKE A GREATER SUM   AND IT IS GOING UP BY LEAPS
     AND BOUNDS 


     LITTLE DISCUSSION TOOK PLACE AFTER THIS  AND THE DINNER SOON BROKE
     UP   ALL WERE QUIET AND SUBDUED  AND LEAVETAKING WAS DONE WITH LOW
     VOICES   IT SEEMED ALMOST THAT THEY WERE SCARED BY THE VISION OF
     THE TIMES THEY HAD SEEN 

     THE SITUATION IS  INDEED  SERIOUS  MR  CALVIN SAID TO ERNEST   I
     HAVE LITTLE QUARREL WITH THE WAY YOU HAVE DEPICTED IT   ONLY I
     DISAGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE DOOM OF THE MIDDLE CLASS   WE SHALL
     SURVIVE  AND WE SHALL OVERTHROW THE TRUSTS 

     AND RETURN TO THE WAYS OF YOUR FATHERS  ERNEST FINISHED FOR HIM 

     EVEN SO  MR  CALVIN ANSWERED GRAVELY   I KNOW ITS A SORT OF
     MACHINEBREAKING  AND THAT IT IS ABSURD   BUT THEN LIFE SEEMS
     ABSURD TODAY  WHAT OF THE MACHINATIONS OF THE PLUTOCRACY   AND AT
     ANY RATE  OUR SORT OF MACHINEBREAKING IS AT LEAST PRACTICAL AND
     POSSIBLE  WHICH YOUR DREAM IS NOT   YOUR SOCIALISTIC DREAM IS      
     WELL  A DREAM   WE CANNOT FOLLOW YOU 

     I ONLY WISH YOU FELLOWS KNEW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT EVOLUTION
     AND SOCIOLOGY  ERNEST SAID WISTFULLY  AS THEY SHOOK HANDS   WE
     WOULD BE SAVED SO MUCH TROUBLE IF YOU DID 



CHAPTER X

THE VORTEX


FOLLOWING LIKE THUNDER CLAPS UPON THE BUSINESS MENS DINNER  OCCURRED
EVENT AFTER EVENT OF TERRIFYING MOMENT AND I  LITTLE I  WHO HAD LIVED
SO PLACIDLY ALL MY DAYS IN THE QUIET UNIVERSITY TOWN  FOUND MYSELF AND
MY PERSONAL AFFAIRS DRAWN INTO THE VORTEX OF THE GREAT WORLDAFFAIRS 
WHETHER IT WAS MY LOVE FOR ERNEST  OR THE CLEAR SIGHT HE HAD GIVEN ME OF
THE SOCIETY IN WHICH I LIVED  THAT MADE ME A REVOLUTIONIST  I KNOW NOT
BUT A REVOLUTIONIST I BECAME  AND I WAS PLUNGED INTO A WHIRL OF
HAPPENINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCONCEIVABLE THREE SHORT MONTHS BEFORE 

THE CRISIS IN MY OWN FORTUNES CAME SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH GREAT CRISES IN
SOCIETY  FIRST OF ALL  FATHER WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE UNIVERSITY  OH 
HE WAS NOT TECHNICALLY DISCHARGED  HIS RESIGNATION WAS DEMANDED  THAT
WAS ALL  THIS  IN ITSELF  DID NOT AMOUNT TO MUCH  FATHER  IN FACT  WAS
DELIGHTED  HE WAS ESPECIALLY DELIGHTED BECAUSE HIS DISCHARGE HAD BEEN
PRECIPITATED BY THE PUBLICATION OF HIS BOOK  ECONOMICS AND EDUCATION 
IT CLINCHED HIS ARGUMENT  HE CONTENDED  WHAT BETTER EVIDENCE COULD BE
ADVANCED TO PROVE THAT EDUCATION WAS DOMINATED BY THE CAPITALIST CLASS

BUT THIS PROOF NEVER GOT ANYWHERE  NOBODY KNEW HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO
RESIGN FROM THE UNIVERSITY  HE WAS SO EMINENT A SCIENTIST THAT SUCH AN
ANNOUNCEMENT  COUPLED WITH THE REASON FOR HIS ENFORCED RESIGNATION 
WOULD HAVE CREATED SOMEWHAT OF A FUROR ALL OVER THE WORLD  THE
NEWSPAPERS SHOWERED HIM WITH PRAISE AND HONOR  AND COMMENDED HIM FOR
HAVING GIVEN UP THE DRUDGERY OF THE LECTURE ROOM IN ORDER TO DEVOTE HIS
WHOLE TIME TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH 

AT FIRST FATHER LAUGHED  THEN HE BECAME ANGRYTONIC ANGRY  THEN CAME
THE SUPPRESSION OF HIS BOOK  THIS SUPPRESSION WAS PERFORMED SECRETLY 
SO SECRETLY THAT AT FIRST WE COULD NOT COMPREHEND  THE PUBLICATION OF
THE BOOK HAD IMMEDIATELY CAUSED A BIT OF EXCITEMENT IN THE COUNTRY 
FATHER HAD BEEN POLITELY ABUSED IN THE CAPITALIST PRESS  THE TONE OF THE
ABUSE BEING TO THE EFFECT THAT IT WAS A PITY SO GREAT A SCIENTIST SHOULD
LEAVE HIS FIELD AND INVADE THE REALM OF SOCIOLOGY  ABOUT WHICH HE KNEW
NOTHING AND WHEREIN HE HAD PROMPTLY BECOME LOST  THIS LASTED FOR A
WEEK  WHILE FATHER CHUCKLED AND SAID THE BOOK HAD TOUCHED A SORE SPOT ON
CAPITALISM  AND THEN  ABRUPTLY  THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE CRITICAL
MAGAZINES CEASED SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THE BOOK AT ALL  ALSO  AND WITH
EQUAL SUDDENNESS  THE BOOK DISAPPEARED FROM THE MARKET  NOT A COPY WAS
OBTAINABLE FROM ANY BOOKSELLER  FATHER WROTE TO THE PUBLISHERS AND WAS
INFORMED THAT THE PLATES HAD BEEN ACCIDENTALLY INJURED  AN
UNSATISFACTORY CORRESPONDENCE FOLLOWED  DRIVEN FINALLY TO AN
UNEQUIVOCAL STAND  THE PUBLISHERS STATED THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE THEIR
WAY TO PUTTING THE BOOK INTO TYPE AGAIN  BUT THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO
RELINQUISH THEIR RIGHTS IN IT 

AND YOU WONT FIND ANOTHER PUBLISHING HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY TO TOUCH
IT  ERNEST SAID  AND IF I WERE YOU  ID HUNT COVER RIGHT NOW  YOUVE
MERELY GOT A FORETASTE OF THE IRON HEEL 

BUT FATHER WAS NOTHING IF NOT A SCIENTIST  HE NEVER BELIEVED IN JUMPING
TO CONCLUSIONS  A LABORATORY EXPERIMENT WAS NO EXPERIMENT IF IT WERE
NOT CARRIED THROUGH IN ALL ITS DETAILS  SO HE PATIENTLY WENT THE ROUND
OF THE PUBLISHING HOUSES  THEY GAVE A MULTITUDE OF EXCUSES  BUT NOT ONE
HOUSE WOULD CONSIDER THE BOOK 

WHEN FATHER BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE BOOK HAD ACTUALLY BEEN SUPPRESSED 
HE TRIED TO GET THE FACT INTO THE NEWSPAPERS BUT HIS COMMUNICATIONS
WERE IGNORED  AT A POLITICAL MEETING OF THE SOCIALISTS  WHERE MANY
REPORTERS WERE PRESENT  FATHER SAW HIS CHANCE  HE AROSE AND RELATED THE
HISTORY OF THE SUPPRESSION OF THE BOOK  HE LAUGHED NEXT DAY WHEN HE
READ THE NEWSPAPERS  AND THEN HE GREW ANGRY TO A DEGREE THAT ELIMINATED
ALL TONIC QUALITIES  THE PAPERS MADE NO MENTION OF THE BOOK  BUT THEY
MISREPORTED HIM BEAUTIFULLY  THEY TWISTED HIS WORDS AND PHRASES AWAY
FROM THE CONTEXT  AND TURNED HIS SUBDUED AND CONTROLLED REMARKS INTO A
HOWLING ANARCHISTIC SPEECH  IT WAS DONE ARTFULLY  ONE INSTANCE  IN
PARTICULAR  I REMEMBER  HE HAD USED THE PHRASE SOCIAL REVOLUTION 
THE REPORTER MERELY DROPPED OUT SOCIAL  THIS WAS SENT OUT ALL OVER
THE COUNTRY IN AN ASSOCIATED PRESS DESPATCH  AND FROM ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY AROSE A CRY OF ALARM  FATHER WAS BRANDED AS A NIHILIST AND AN
ANARCHIST  AND IN ONE CARTOON THAT WAS COPIED WIDELY HE WAS PORTRAYED
WAVING A RED FLAG AT THE HEAD OF A MOB OF LONGHAIRED  WILDEYED MEN WHO
BORE IN THEIR HANDS TORCHES  KNIVES  AND DYNAMITE BOMBS 

HE WAS ASSAILED TERRIBLY IN THE PRESS  IN LONG AND ABUSIVE EDITORIALS 
FOR HIS ANARCHY  AND HINTS WERE MADE OF MENTAL BREAKDOWN ON HIS PART 
THIS BEHAVIOR  ON THE PART OF THE CAPITALIST PRESS  WAS NOTHING NEW 
ERNEST TOLD US  IT WAS THE CUSTOM  HE SAID  TO SEND REPORTERS TO ALL
THE SOCIALIST MEETINGS FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF MISREPORTING AND
DISTORTING WHAT WAS SAID  IN ORDER TO FRIGHTEN THE MIDDLE CLASS AWAY
FROM ANY POSSIBLE AFFILIATION WITH THE PROLETARIAT  AND REPEATEDLY
ERNEST WARNED FATHER TO CEASE FIGHTING AND TO TAKE TO COVER 

THE SOCIALIST PRESS OF THE COUNTRY TOOK UP THE FIGHT  HOWEVER  AND
THROUGHOUT THE READING PORTION OF THE WORKING CLASS IT WAS KNOWN THAT
THE BOOK HAD BEEN SUPPRESSED  BUT THIS KNOWLEDGE STOPPED WITH THE
WORKING CLASS  NEXT  THE APPEAL TO REASON  A BIG SOCIALIST PUBLISHING
HOUSE  ARRANGED WITH FATHER TO BRING OUT THE BOOK  FATHER WAS JUBILANT 
BUT ERNEST WAS ALARMED 

I TELL YOU WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF THE UNKNOWN  HE INSISTED  BIG
THINGS ARE HAPPENING SECRETLY ALL AROUND US  WE CAN FEEL THEM  WE DO
NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE  BUT THEY ARE THERE  THE WHOLE FABRIC OF SOCIETY
IS ATREMBLE WITH THEM  DONT ASK ME  I DONT KNOW MYSELF  BUT OUT OF
THIS FLUX OF SOCIETY SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO CRYSTALLIZE  IT IS
CRYSTALLIZING NOW  THE SUPPRESSION OF THE BOOK IS A PRECIPITATION  HOW
MANY BOOKS HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED WE HAVENT THE LEAST IDEA  WE ARE IN
THE DARK  WE HAVE NO WAY OF LEARNING  WATCH OUT NEXT FOR THE
SUPPRESSION OF THE SOCIALIST PRESS AND SOCIALIST PUBLISHING HOUSES  IM
AFRAID ITS COMING  WE ARE GOING TO BE THROTTLED 

ERNEST HAD HIS HAND ON THE PULSE OF EVENTS EVEN MORE CLOSELY THAN THE
REST OF THE SOCIALISTS  AND WITHIN TWO DAYS THE FIRST BLOW WAS STRUCK 
THE APPEAL TO REASON WAS A WEEKLY  AND ITS REGULAR CIRCULATION AMONGST
THE PROLETARIAT WAS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND  ALSO  IT VERY
FREQUENTLY GOT OUT SPECIAL EDITIONS OF FROM TWO TO FIVE MILLIONS  THESE
GREAT EDITIONS WERE PAID FOR AND DISTRIBUTED BY THE SMALL ARMY OF
VOLUNTARY WORKERS WHO HAD MARSHALLED AROUND THE APPEAL  THE FIRST BLOW
WAS AIMED AT THESE SPECIAL EDITIONS  AND IT WAS A CRUSHING ONE  BY AN
ARBITRARY RULING OF THE POST OFFICE  THESE EDITIONS WERE DECIDED TO BE
NOT THE REGULAR CIRCULATION OF THE PAPER  AND FOR THAT REASON WERE
DENIED ADMISSION TO THE MAILS 

A WEEK LATER THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT RULED THAT THE PAPER WAS
SEDITIOUS  AND BARRED IT ENTIRELY FROM THE MAILS  THIS WAS A FEARFUL
BLOW TO THE SOCIALIST PROPAGANDA  THE APPEAL WAS DESPERATE  IT DEVISED
A PLAN OF REACHING ITS SUBSCRIBERS THROUGH THE EXPRESS COMPANIES  BUT
THEY DECLINED TO HANDLE IT  THIS WAS THE END OF THE APPEAL  BUT NOT
QUITE  IT PREPARED TO GO ON WITH ITS BOOK PUBLISHING  TWENTY THOUSAND
COPIES OF FATHERS BOOK WERE IN THE BINDERY  AND THE PRESSES WERE
TURNING OFF MORE  AND THEN  WITHOUT WARNING  A MOB AROSE ONE NIGHT 
AND  UNDER A WAVING AMERICAN FLAG  SINGING PATRIOTIC SONGS  SET FIRE TO
THE GREAT PLANT OF THE APPEAL AND TOTALLY DESTROYED IT 

NOW GIRARD  KANSAS  WAS A QUIET  PEACEABLE TOWN  THERE HAD NEVER BEEN
ANY LABOR TROUBLES THERE  THE APPEAL PAID UNION WAGES AND  IN FACT 
WAS THE BACKBONE OF THE TOWN  GIVING EMPLOYMENT TO HUNDREDS OF MEN AND
WOMEN  IT WAS NOT THE CITIZENS OF GIRARD THAT COMPOSED THE MOB  THIS
MOB HAD RISEN UP OUT OF THE EARTH APPARENTLY  AND TO ALL INTENTS AND
PURPOSES  ITS WORK DONE  IT HAD GONE BACK INTO THE EARTH  ERNEST SAW IN
THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT 

THE BLACK HUNDREDS ARE BEING ORGANIZED IN THE UNITED STATES  HE SAID 
THIS IS THE BEGINNING  THERE WILL BE MORE OF IT  THE IRON HEEL IS
GETTING BOLD 

      THE BLACK HUNDREDS WERE REACTIONARY MOBS ORGANIZED BY THE
     PERISHING AUTOCRACY IN THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION   THESE
     REACTIONARY GROUPS ATTACKED THE REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS  AND
     ALSO  AT NEEDED MOMENTS  RIOTED AND DESTROYED PROPERTY SO AS
     TO AFFORD THE AUTOCRACY THE PRETEXT OF CALLING OUT THE
     COSSACKS 

AND SO PERISHED FATHERS BOOK  WE WERE TO SEE MUCH OF THE BLACK HUNDREDS
AS THE DAYS WENT BY  WEEK BY WEEK MORE OF THE SOCIALIST PAPERS WERE
BARRED FROM THE MAILS  AND IN A NUMBER OF INSTANCES THE BLACK HUNDREDS
DESTROYED THE SOCIALIST PRESSES  OF COURSE  THE NEWSPAPERS OF THE
LAND LIVED UP TO THE REACTIONARY POLICY OF THE RULING CLASS  AND THE
DESTROYED SOCIALIST PRESS WAS MISREPRESENTED AND VILIFIED  WHILE
THE BLACK HUNDREDS WERE REPRESENTED AS TRUE PATRIOTS AND SAVIOURS OF
SOCIETY  SO CONVINCING WAS ALL THIS MISREPRESENTATION THAT EVEN SINCERE
MINISTERS IN THE PULPIT PRAISED THE BLACK HUNDREDS WHILE REGRETTING THE
NECESSITY OF VIOLENCE 

HISTORY WAS MAKING FAST  THE FALL ELECTIONS WERE SOON TO OCCUR  AND
ERNEST WAS NOMINATED BY THE SOCIALIST PARTY TO RUN FOR CONGRESS  HIS
CHANCE FOR ELECTION WAS MOST FAVORABLE  THE STREETCAR STRIKE IN SAN
FRANCISCO HAD BEEN BROKEN  AND FOLLOWING UPON IT THE TEAMSTERS STRIKE
HAD BEEN BROKEN  THESE TWO DEFEATS HAD BEEN VERY DISASTROUS TO ORGANIZED
LABOR  THE WHOLE WATER FRONT FEDERATION  ALONG WITH ITS ALLIES IN THE
STRUCTURAL TRADES  HAD BACKED UP THE TEAMSTERS  AND ALL HAD SMASHED
DOWN INGLORIOUSLY  IT HAD BEEN A BLOODY STRIKE  THE POLICE HAD BROKEN
COUNTLESS HEADS WITH THEIR RIOT CLUBS AND THE DEATH LIST HAD BEEN
AUGMENTED BY THE TURNING LOOSE OF A MACHINEGUN ON THE STRIKERS FROM THE
BARNS OF THE MARSDEN SPECIAL DELIVERY COMPANY 

IN CONSEQUENCE  THE MEN WERE SULLEN AND VINDICTIVE  THEY WANTED BLOOD 
AND REVENGE  BEATEN ON THEIR CHOSEN FIELD  THEY WERE RIPE TO SEEK
REVENGE BY MEANS OF POLITICAL ACTION  THEY STILL MAINTAINED THEIR LABOR
ORGANIZATION  AND THIS GAVE THEM STRENGTH IN THE POLITICAL STRUGGLE THAT
WAS ON  ERNESTS CHANCE FOR ELECTION GREW STRONGER AND STRONGER  DAY BY
DAY UNIONS AND MORE UNIONS VOTED THEIR SUPPORT TO THE SOCIALISTS  UNTIL
EVEN ERNEST LAUGHED WHEN THE UNDERTAKERS ASSISTANTS AND THE CHICKEN
PICKERS FELL INTO LINE  LABOR BECAME MULISH  WHILE IT PACKED THE
SOCIALIST MEETINGS WITH MAD ENTHUSIASM  IT WAS IMPERVIOUS TO THE WILES
OF THE OLDPARTY POLITICIANS  THE OLDPARTY ORATORS WERE USUALLY GREETED
WITH EMPTY HALLS  THOUGH OCCASIONALLY THEY ENCOUNTERED FULL HALLS WHERE
THEY WERE SO ROUGHLY HANDLED THAT MORE THAN ONCE IT WAS NECESSARY TO
CALL OUT THE POLICE RESERVES 

HISTORY WAS MAKING FAST  THE AIR WAS VIBRANT WITH THINGS HAPPENING AND
IMPENDING  THE COUNTRY WAS ON THE VERGE OF HARD TIMES  CAUSED BY A
SERIES OF PROSPEROUS YEARS WHEREIN THE DIFFICULTY OF DISPOSING ABROAD
OF THE UNCONSUMED SURPLUS HAD BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT  INDUSTRIES
WERE WORKING SHORT TIME MANY GREAT FACTORIES WERE STANDING IDLE AGAINST
THE TIME WHEN THE SURPLUS SHOULD BE GONE AND WAGES WERE BEING CUT RIGHT
AND LEFT 

      UNDER THE CAPITALIST REGIME THESE PERIODS OF HARD TIMES
     WERE AS INEVITABLE AS THEY WERE ABSURD   PROSPERITY ALWAYS
     BROUGHT CALAMITY   THIS  OF COURSE  WAS DUE TO THE EXCESS OF
     UNCONSUMED PROFITS THAT WAS PILED UP 

ALSO  THE GREAT MACHINIST STRIKE HAD BEEN BROKEN  TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
MACHINISTS  ALONG WITH THEIR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ALLIES IN THE
METALWORKING TRADES  HAD BEEN DEFEATED IN AS BLOODY A STRIKE AS HAD EVER
MARRED THE UNITED STATES  PITCHED BATTLES HAD BEEN FOUGHT WITH THE SMALL
ARMIES OF ARMED STRIKEBREAKERS PUT IN THE FIELD BY THE EMPLOYERS
ASSOCIATIONS THE BLACK HUNDREDS  APPEARING IN SCORES OF WIDESCATTERED
PLACES  HAD DESTROYED PROPERTY AND  IN CONSEQUENCE  A HUNDRED THOUSAND
REGULAR SOLDIERS OF THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN CALLED OUT TO PUT A
FRIGHTFUL END TO THE WHOLE AFFAIR  A NUMBER OF THE LABOR LEADERS HAD
BEEN EXECUTED MANY OTHERS HAD BEEN SENTENCED TO PRISON  WHILE THOUSANDS
OF THE RANK AND FILE OF THE STRIKERS HAD BEEN HERDED INTO BULLPENS
AND ABOMINABLY TREATED BY THE SOLDIERS 

      STRIKEBREAKERSTHESE WERE  IN PURPOSE AND PRACTICE AND
     EVERYTHING EXCEPT NAME  THE PRIVATE SOLDIERS OF THE
     CAPITALISTS  THEY WERE THOROUGHLY ORGANIZED AND WELL ARMED 
     AND THEY WERE HELD IN READINESS TO BE HURLED IN SPECIAL
     TRAINS TO ANY PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE LABOR WENT ON STRIKE
     OR WAS LOCKED OUT BY THE EMPLOYERS   ONLY THOSE CURIOUS
     TIMES COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO THE AMAZING SPECTACLE OF ONE 
     FARLEY  A NOTORIOUS COMMANDER OF STRIKEBREAKERS  WHO  IN
       SWEPT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES IN SPECIAL TRAINS FROM
     NEW YORK TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH AN ARMY OF TWENTYFIVE
     HUNDRED MEN  FULLY ARMED AND EQUIPPED  TO BREAK A STRIKE OF
     THE SAN FRANCISCO STREETCAR MEN   SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT
     VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND   THE FACT THAT THIS ACT 
     AND THOUSANDS OF SIMILAR ACTS  WENT UNPUNISHED  GOES TO SHOW
     HOW COMPLETELY THE JUDICIARY WAS THE CREATURE OF THE
     PLUTOCRACY 

      BULLPENIN A MINERS STRIKE IN IDAHO  IN THE LATTER
     PART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY  IT HAPPENED THAT MANY OF THE
     STRIKERS WERE CONFINED IN A BULLPEN BY THE TROOPS   THE
     PRACTICE AND THE NAME CONTINUED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 

THE YEARS OF PROSPERITY WERE NOW TO BE PAID FOR  ALL MARKETS WERE
GLUTTED ALL MARKETS WERE FALLING AND AMIDST THE GENERAL CRUMBLE
OF PRICES THE PRICE OF LABOR CRUMBLED FASTEST OF ALL  THE LAND WAS
CONVULSED WITH INDUSTRIAL DISSENSIONS  LABOR WAS STRIKING HERE  THERE 
AND EVERYWHERE AND WHERE IT WAS NOT STRIKING  IT WAS BEING TURNED OUT
BY THE CAPITALISTS  THE PAPERS WERE FILLED WITH TALES OF VIOLENCE AND
BLOOD  AND THROUGH IT ALL THE BLACK HUNDREDS PLAYED THEIR PART  RIOT 
ARSON  AND WANTON DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY WAS THEIR FUNCTION  AND WELL
THEY PERFORMED IT  THE WHOLE REGULAR ARMY WAS IN THE FIELD  CALLED THERE
BY THE ACTIONS OF THE BLACK HUNDREDS  ALL CITIES AND TOWNS WERE LIKE
ARMED CAMPS  AND LABORERS WERE SHOT DOWN LIKE DOGS  OUT OF THE VAST
ARMY OF THE UNEMPLOYED THE STRIKEBREAKERS WERE RECRUITED AND WHEN
THE STRIKEBREAKERS WERE WORSTED BY THE LABOR UNIONS  THE TROOPS ALWAYS
APPEARED AND CRUSHED THE UNIONS  THEN THERE WAS THE MILITIA  AS YET  IT
WAS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE SECRET MILITIA LAW  ONLY THE
REGULARLY ORGANIZED MILITIA WAS OUT  AND IT WAS OUT EVERYWHERE  AND
IN THIS TIME OF TERROR  THE REGULAR ARMY WAS INCREASED AN ADDITIONAL
HUNDRED THOUSAND BY THE GOVERNMENT 

      THE NAME ONLY  AND NOT THE IDEA  WAS IMPORTED FROM RUSSIA 
     THE BLACK HUNDREDS WERE A DEVELOPMENT OUT OF THE SECRET
     AGENTS OF THE CAPITALISTS  AND THEIR USE AROSE IN THE LABOR
     STRUGGLES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY   THERE IS NO DISCUSSION
     OF THIS   NO LESS AN AUTHORITY OF THE TIMES THAN CARROLL D 
     WRIGHT  UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER OF LABOR  IS RESPONSIBLE
     FOR THE STATEMENT   FROM HIS BOOK  ENTITLED THE BATTLES OF
     LABOR  IS QUOTED THE DECLARATION THAT IN SOME OF THE GREAT
     HISTORIC STRIKES THE EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES HAVE INSTIGATED
     ACTS OF VIOLENCE THAT MANUFACTURERS HAVE DELIBERATELY
     PROVOKED STRIKES IN ORDER TO GET RID OF SURPLUS STOCK AND
     THAT FREIGHT CARS HAVE BEEN BURNED BY EMPLOYERS AGENTS
     DURING RAILROAD STRIKES IN ORDER TO INCREASE DISORDER   IT
     WAS OUT OF THESE SECRET AGENTS OF THE EMPLOYERS THAT THE
     BLACK HUNDREDS AROSE AND IT WAS THEY  IN TURN  THAT LATER
     BECAME THAT TERRIBLE WEAPON OF THE OLIGARCHY  THE AGENTS
     PROVOCATEURS 

NEVER HAD LABOR RECEIVED SUCH AN ALLAROUND BEATING  THE GREAT CAPTAINS
OF INDUSTRY  THE OLIGARCHS  HAD FOR THE FIRST TIME THROWN THEIR FULL
WEIGHT INTO THE BREACH THE STRUGGLING EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATIONS HAD MADE 
THESE ASSOCIATIONS WERE PRACTICALLY MIDDLECLASS AFFAIRS  AND NOW 
COMPELLED BY HARD TIMES AND CRASHING MARKETS  AND AIDED BY THE GREAT
CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY  THEY GAVE ORGANIZED LABOR AN AWFUL AND DECISIVE
DEFEAT  IT WAS AN ALLPOWERFUL ALLIANCE  BUT IT WAS AN ALLIANCE OF THE
LION AND THE LAMB  AS THE MIDDLE CLASS WAS SOON TO LEARN 

LABOR WAS BLOODY AND SULLEN  BUT CRUSHED  YET ITS DEFEAT DID NOT PUT
AN END TO THE HARD TIMES  THE BANKS  THEMSELVES CONSTITUTING ONE OF THE
MOST IMPORTANT FORCES OF THE OLIGARCHY  CONTINUED TO CALL IN CREDITS 
THE WALL STREET GROUP TURNED THE STOCK MARKET INTO A MAELSTROM WHERE
THE VALUES OF ALL THE LAND CRUMBLED AWAY ALMOST TO NOTHINGNESS  AND
OUT OF ALL THE RACK AND RUIN ROSE THE FORM OF THE NASCENT OLIGARCHY 
IMPERTURBABLE  INDIFFERENT  AND SURE  ITS SERENITY AND CERTITUDE WAS
TERRIFYING  NOT ONLY DID IT USE ITS OWN VAST POWER  BUT IT USED ALL THE
POWER OF THE UNITED STATES TREASURY TO CARRY OUT ITS PLANS 

      WALL STREETSO NAMED FROM A STREET IN ANCIENT NEW YORK 
     WHERE WAS SITUATED THE STOCK EXCHANGE  AND WHERE THE
     IRRATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY PERMITTED UNDERHANDED
     MANIPULATION OF ALL THE INDUSTRIES OF THE COUNTRY 

THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY HAD TURNED UPON THE MIDDLE CLASS  THE
EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATIONS  THAT HAD HELPED THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY TO
TEAR AND REND LABOR  WERE NOW TORN AND RENT BY THEIR QUONDAM ALLIES 
AMIDST THE CRASHING OF THE MIDDLE MEN  THE SMALL BUSINESS MEN AND
MANUFACTURERS  THE TRUSTS STOOD FIRM  NAY  THE TRUSTS DID MORE THAN
STAND FIRM  THEY WERE ACTIVE  THEY SOWED WIND  AND WIND  AND EVER MORE
WIND FOR THEY ALONE KNEW HOW TO REAP THE WHIRLWIND AND MAKE A PROFIT
OUT OF IT  AND SUCH PROFITS COLOSSAL PROFITS STRONG ENOUGH THEMSELVES
TO WEATHER THE STORM THAT WAS LARGELY THEIR OWN BREWING  THEY TURNED
LOOSE AND PLUNDERED THE WRECKS THAT FLOATED ABOUT THEM  VALUES WERE
PITIFULLY AND INCONCEIVABLY SHRUNKEN  AND THE TRUSTS ADDED HUGELY
TO THEIR HOLDINGS  EVEN EXTENDING THEIR ENTERPRISES INTO MANY NEW
FIELDSAND ALWAYS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS 

THUS THE SUMMER OF  WITNESSED THE VIRTUAL DEATHTHRUST TO THE MIDDLE
CLASS  EVEN ERNEST WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE QUICKNESS WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN
DONE  HE SHOOK HIS HEAD OMINOUSLY AND LOOKED FORWARD WITHOUT HOPE TO THE
FALL ELECTIONS 

ITS NO USE  HE SAID  WE ARE BEATEN  THE IRON HEEL IS HERE  I HAD
HOPED FOR A PEACEABLE VICTORY AT THE BALLOTBOX  I WAS WRONG  WICKSON
WAS RIGHT  WE SHALL BE ROBBED OF OUR FEW REMAINING LIBERTIES THE IRON
HEEL WILL WALK UPON OUR FACES NOTHING REMAINS BUT A BLOODY REVOLUTION
OF THE WORKING CLASS  OF COURSE WE WILL WIN  BUT I SHUDDER TO THINK OF
IT 

AND FROM THEN ON ERNEST PINNED HIS FAITH IN REVOLUTION  IN THIS HE WAS
IN ADVANCE OF HIS PARTY  HIS FELLOWSOCIALISTS COULD NOT AGREE WITH HIM 
THEY STILL INSISTED THAT VICTORY COULD BE GAINED THROUGH THE ELECTIONS 
IT WAS NOT THAT THEY WERE STUNNED  THEY WERE TOO COOLHEADED AND
COURAGEOUS FOR THAT  THEY WERE MERELY INCREDULOUS  THAT WAS ALL  ERNEST
COULD NOT GET THEM SERIOUSLY TO FEAR THE COMING OF THE OLIGARCHY  THEY
WERE STIRRED BY HIM  BUT THEY WERE TOO SURE OF THEIR OWN STRENGTH  THERE
WAS NO ROOM IN THEIR THEORETICAL SOCIAL EVOLUTION FOR AN OLIGARCHY 
THEREFORE THE OLIGARCHY COULD NOT BE 

WELL SEND YOU TO CONGRESS AND IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT  THEY TOLD HIM AT
ONE OF OUR SECRET MEETINGS 

AND WHEN THEY TAKE ME OUT OF CONGRESS  ERNEST REPLIED COLDLY  AND PUT
ME AGAINST A WALL  AND BLOW MY BRAINS OUTWHAT THEN

THEN WELL RISE IN OUR MIGHT  A DOZEN VOICES ANSWERED AT ONCE 

THEN YOULL WELTER IN YOUR GORE  WAS HIS RETORT  IVE HEARD THAT SONG
SUNG BY THE MIDDLE CLASS  AND WHERE IS IT NOW IN ITS MIGHT



CHAPTER XI

THE GREAT ADVENTURE


MR  WICKSON DID NOT SEND FOR FATHER  THEY MET BY CHANCE ON THE
FERRYBOAT TO SAN FRANCISCO  SO THAT THE WARNING HE GAVE FATHER WAS NOT
PREMEDITATED  HAD THEY NOT MET ACCIDENTALLY  THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
ANY WARNING  NOT THAT THE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT  HOWEVER 
FATHER CAME OF STOUT OLD MAYFLOWER STOCK  AND THE BLOOD WAS IMPERATIVE
IN HIM 

      ONE OF THE FIRST SHIPS THAT CARRIED COLONIES TO AMERICA 
     AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE NEW WORLD   DESCENDANTS OF THESE
     ORIGINAL COLONISTS WERE FOR A WHILE INORDINATELY PROUD OF
     THEIR GENEALOGY BUT IN TIME THE BLOOD BECAME SO WIDELY
     DIFFUSED THAT IT RAN IN THE VEINS PRACTICALLY OF ALL
     AMERICANS 

ERNEST WAS RIGHT  HE TOLD ME  AS SOON AS HE HAD RETURNED HOME  ERNEST
IS A VERY REMARKABLE YOUNG MAN  AND ID RATHER SEE YOU HIS WIFE THAN THE
WIFE OF ROCKEFELLER HIMSELF OR THE KING OF ENGLAND 

WHATS THE MATTER I ASKED IN ALARM 

THE OLIGARCHY IS ABOUT TO TREAD UPON OUR FACESYOURS AND MINE  WICKSON
AS MUCH AS TOLD ME SO  HE WAS VERY KINDFOR AN OLIGARCH  HE OFFERED TO
REINSTATE ME IN THE UNIVERSITY  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT HE  WICKSON 
A SORDID MONEYGRABBER  HAS THE POWER TO DETERMINE WHETHER I SHALL OR
SHALL NOT TEACH IN THE UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE  BUT HE OFFERED ME EVEN
BETTER THAN THATOFFERED TO MAKE ME PRESIDENT OF SOME GREAT COLLEGE OF
PHYSICAL SCIENCES THAT IS BEING PLANNEDTHE OLIGARCHY MUST GET RID OF
ITS SURPLUS SOMEHOW  YOU SEE 

DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD THAT SOCIALIST LOVER OF YOUR DAUGHTERS
HE SAID  I TOLD HIM THAT WE WOULD WALK UPON THE FACES OF THE WORKING
CLASS  AND SO WE SHALL  AS FOR YOU  I HAVE FOR YOU A DEEP RESPECT AS
A SCIENTIST BUT IF YOU THROW YOUR FORTUNES IN WITH THE WORKING
CLASSWELL  WATCH OUT FOR YOUR FACE  THAT IS ALL  AND THEN HE TURNED
AND LEFT ME 

IT MEANS WELL HAVE TO MARRY EARLIER THAN YOU PLANNED  WAS ERNESTS
COMMENT WHEN WE TOLD HIM 

I COULD NOT FOLLOW HIS REASONING  BUT I WAS SOON TO LEARN IT  IT WAS AT
THIS TIME THAT THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF THE SIERRA MILLS WAS PAIDOR 
RATHER  SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID  FOR FATHER DID NOT RECEIVE HIS  AFTER
WAITING SEVERAL DAYS  FATHER WROTE TO THE SECRETARY  PROMPTLY CAME
THE REPLY THAT THERE WAS NO RECORD ON THE BOOKS OF FATHERS OWNING ANY
STOCK  AND A POLITE REQUEST FOR MORE EXPLICIT INFORMATION 

ILL MAKE IT EXPLICIT ENOUGH  CONFOUND HIM  FATHER DECLARED  AND
DEPARTED FOR THE BANK TO GET THE STOCK IN QUESTION FROM HIS SAFEDEPOSIT
BOX 

ERNEST IS A VERY REMARKABLE MAN  HE SAID WHEN HE GOT BACK AND WHILE
I WAS HELPING HIM OFF WITH HIS OVERCOAT  I REPEAT  MY DAUGHTER  THAT
YOUNG MAN OF YOURS IS A VERY REMARKABLE YOUNG MAN 

I HAD LEARNED  WHENEVER HE PRAISED ERNEST IN SUCH FASHION  TO EXPECT
DISASTER 

THEY HAVE ALREADY WALKED UPON MY FACE  FATHER EXPLAINED  THERE WAS NO
STOCK  THE BOX WAS EMPTY  YOU AND ERNEST WILL HAVE TO GET MARRIED PRETTY
QUICKLY 

FATHER INSISTED ON LABORATORY METHODS  HE BROUGHT THE SIERRA MILLS INTO
COURT  BUT HE COULD NOT BRING THE BOOKS OF THE SIERRA MILLS INTO COURT 
HE DID NOT CONTROL THE COURTS  AND THE SIERRA MILLS DID  THAT EXPLAINED
IT ALL  HE WAS THOROUGHLY BEATEN BY THE LAW  AND THE BAREFACED ROBBERY
HELD GOOD 

IT IS ALMOST LAUGHABLE NOW  WHEN I LOOK BACK ON IT  THE WAY FATHER WAS
BEATEN  HE MET WICKSON ACCIDENTALLY ON THE STREET IN SAN FRANCISCO 
AND HE TOLD WICKSON THAT HE WAS A DAMNED SCOUNDREL  AND THEN FATHER WAS
ARRESTED FOR ATTEMPTED ASSAULT  FINED IN THE POLICE COURT  AND BOUND
OVER TO KEEP THE PEACE  IT WAS ALL SO RIDICULOUS THAT WHEN HE GOT
HOME HE HAD TO LAUGH HIMSELF  BUT WHAT A FUROR WAS RAISED IN THE
LOCAL PAPERS THERE WAS GRAVE TALK ABOUT THE BACILLUS OF VIOLENCE THAT
INFECTED ALL MEN WHO EMBRACED SOCIALISM AND FATHER  WITH HIS LONG AND
PEACEFUL LIFE  WAS INSTANCED AS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF HOW THE BACILLUS
OF VIOLENCE WORKED  ALSO  IT WAS ASSERTED BY MORE THAN ONE PAPER THAT
FATHERS MIND HAD WEAKENED UNDER THE STRAIN OF SCIENTIFIC STUDY  AND
CONFINEMENT IN A STATE ASYLUM FOR THE INSANE WAS SUGGESTED  NOR WAS THIS
MERELY TALK  IT WAS AN IMMINENT PERIL  BUT FATHER WAS WISE ENOUGH TO SEE
IT  HE HAD THE BISHOPS EXPERIENCE TO LESSON FROM  AND HE LESSONED
WELL  HE KEPT QUIET NO MATTER WHAT INJUSTICE WAS PERPETRATED ON HIM  AND
REALLY  I THINK  SURPRISED HIS ENEMIES 

THERE WAS THE MATTER OF THE HOUSEOUR HOME  A MORTGAGE WAS FORECLOSED
ON IT  AND WE HAD TO GIVE UP POSSESSION  OF COURSE THERE WASNT ANY
MORTGAGE  AND NEVER HAD BEEN ANY MORTGAGE  THE GROUND HAD BEEN BOUGHT
OUTRIGHT  AND THE HOUSE HAD BEEN PAID FOR WHEN IT WAS BUILT  AND HOUSE
AND LOT HAD ALWAYS BEEN FREE AND UNENCUMBERED  NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS
THE MORTGAGE  PROPERLY AND LEGALLY DRAWN UP AND SIGNED  WITH A RECORD
OF THE PAYMENTS OF INTEREST THROUGH A NUMBER OF YEARS  FATHER MADE NO
OUTCRY  AS HE HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS MONEY  SO WAS HE NOW ROBBED OF HIS
HOME  AND HE HAD NO RECOURSE  THE MACHINERY OF SOCIETY WAS IN THE HANDS
OF THOSE WHO WERE BENT ON BREAKING HIM  HE WAS A PHILOSOPHER AT HEART 
AND HE WAS NO LONGER EVEN ANGRY 

I AM DOOMED TO BE BROKEN  HE SAID TO ME BUT THAT IS NO REASON THAT I
SHOULD NOT TRY TO BE SHATTERED AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE  THESE OLD BONES OF
MINE ARE FRAGILE  AND IVE LEARNED MY LESSON  GOD KNOWS I DONT WANT TO
SPEND MY LAST DAYS IN AN INSANE ASYLUM 

WHICH REMINDS ME OF BISHOP MOREHOUSE  WHOM I HAVE NEGLECTED FOR MANY
PAGES  BUT FIRST LET ME TELL OF MY MARRIAGE  IN THE PLAY OF EVENTS  MY
MARRIAGE SINKS INTO INSIGNIFICANCE  I KNOW  SO I SHALL BARELY MENTION
IT 

NOW WE SHALL BECOME REAL PROLETARIANS  FATHER SAID  WHEN WE WERE
DRIVEN FROM OUR HOME  I HAVE OFTEN ENVIED THAT YOUNG MAN OF YOURS FOR
HIS ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROLETARIAT  NOW I SHALL SEE AND LEARN FOR
MYSELF 

FATHER MUST HAVE HAD STRONG IN HIM THE BLOOD OF ADVENTURE  HE LOOKED
UPON OUR CATASTROPHE IN THE LIGHT OF AN ADVENTURE  NO ANGER NOR
BITTERNESS POSSESSED HIM  HE WAS TOO PHILOSOPHIC AND SIMPLE TO BE
VINDICTIVE  AND HE LIVED TOO MUCH IN THE WORLD OF MIND TO MISS THE
CREATURE COMFORTS WE WERE GIVING UP  SO IT WAS  WHEN WE MOVED TO SAN
FRANCISCO INTO FOUR WRETCHED ROOMS IN THE SLUM SOUTH OF MARKET STREET 
THAT HE EMBARKED UPON THE ADVENTURE WITH THE JOY AND ENTHUSIASM OF
A CHILDCOMBINED WITH THE CLEAR SIGHT AND MENTAL GRASP OF AN
EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECT  HE REALLY NEVER CRYSTALLIZED MENTALLY  HE HAD
NO FALSE SENSE OF VALUES  CONVENTIONAL OR HABITUAL VALUES MEANT NOTHING
TO HIM  THE ONLY VALUES HE RECOGNIZED WERE MATHEMATICAL AND SCIENTIFIC
FACTS  MY FATHER WAS A GREAT MAN  HE HAD THE MIND AND THE SOUL THAT ONLY
GREAT MEN HAVE  IN WAYS HE WAS EVEN GREATER THAN ERNEST  THAN WHOM I
HAVE KNOWN NONE GREATER 

EVEN I FOUND SOME RELIEF IN OUR CHANGE OF LIVING  IF NOTHING ELSE  I
WAS ESCAPING FROM THE ORGANIZED OSTRACISM THAT HAD BEEN OUR INCREASING
PORTION IN THE UNIVERSITY TOWN EVER SINCE THE ENMITY OF THE NASCENT
OLIGARCHY HAD BEEN INCURRED  AND THE CHANGE WAS TO ME LIKEWISE
ADVENTURE  AND THE GREATEST OF ALL  FOR IT WAS LOVEADVENTURE  THE
CHANGE IN OUR FORTUNES HAD HASTENED MY MARRIAGE  AND IT WAS AS A
WIFE THAT I CAME TO LIVE IN THE FOUR ROOMS ON PELL STREET  IN THE SAN
FRANCISCO SLUM 

AND THIS OUT OF ALL REMAINS  I MADE ERNEST HAPPY  I CAME INTO HIS STORMY
LIFE  NOT AS A NEW PERTURBING FORCE  BUT AS ONE THAT MADE TOWARD PEACE
AND REPOSE  I GAVE HIM REST  IT WAS THE GUERDON OF MY LOVE FOR HIM 
IT WAS THE ONE INFALLIBLE TOKEN THAT I HAD NOT FAILED  TO BRING
FORGETFULNESS  OR THE LIGHT OF GLADNESS  INTO THOSE POOR TIRED EYES OF
HISWHAT GREATER JOY COULD HAVE BLESSED ME THAN THAT

THOSE DEAR TIRED EYES  HE TOILED AS FEW MEN EVER TOILED  AND ALL HIS
LIFETIME HE TOILED FOR OTHERS  THAT WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS MANHOOD  HE
WAS A HUMANIST AND A LOVER  AND HE  WITH HIS INCARNATE SPIRIT OF BATTLE 
HIS GLADIATOR BODY AND HIS EAGLE SPIRITHE WAS AS GENTLE AND TENDER TO
ME AS A POET  HE WAS A POET  A SINGER IN DEEDS  AND ALL HIS LIFE HE SANG
THE SONG OF MAN  AND HE DID IT OUT OF SHEER LOVE OF MAN  AND FOR MAN HE
GAVE HIS LIFE AND WAS CRUCIFIED 

AND ALL THIS HE DID WITH NO HOPE OF FUTURE REWARD  IN HIS CONCEPTION OF
THINGS THERE WAS NO FUTURE LIFE  HE  WHO FAIRLY BURNT WITH IMMORTALITY 
DENIED HIMSELF IMMORTALITYSUCH WAS THE PARADOX OF HIM  HE  SO WARM
IN SPIRIT  WAS DOMINATED BY THAT COLD AND FORBIDDING PHILOSOPHY 
MATERIALISTIC MONISM  I USED TO REFUTE HIM BY TELLING HIM THAT I
MEASURED HIS IMMORTALITY BY THE WINGS OF HIS SOUL  AND THAT I SHOULD
HAVE TO LIVE ENDLESS AEONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE FULL MEASUREMENT 
WHEREAT HE WOULD LAUGH  AND HIS ARMS WOULD LEAP OUT TO ME  AND HE WOULD
CALL ME HIS SWEET METAPHYSICIAN AND THE TIREDNESS WOULD PASS OUT OF HIS
EYES  AND INTO THEM WOULD FLOOD THE HAPPY LOVELIGHT THAT WAS IN ITSELF
A NEW AND SUFFICIENT ADVERTISEMENT OF HIS IMMORTALITY 

ALSO  HE USED TO CALL ME HIS DUALIST  AND HE WOULD EXPLAIN HOW KANT  BY
MEANS OF PURE REASON  HAD ABOLISHED REASON  IN ORDER TO WORSHIP GOD  AND
HE DREW THE PARALLEL AND INCLUDED ME GUILTY OF A SIMILAR ACT  AND WHEN I
PLEADED GUILTY  BUT DEFENDED THE ACT AS HIGHLY RATIONAL  HE BUT PRESSED
ME CLOSER AND LAUGHED AS ONLY ONE OF GODS OWN LOVERS COULD LAUGH  I
WAS WONT TO DENY THAT HEREDITY AND ENVIRONMENT COULD EXPLAIN HIS OWN
ORIGINALITY AND GENIUS  ANY MORE THAN COULD THE COLD GROPING FINGER OF
SCIENCE CATCH AND ANALYZE AND CLASSIFY THAT ELUSIVE ESSENCE THAT LURKED
IN THE CONSTITUTION OF LIFE ITSELF 

I HELD THAT SPACE WAS AN APPARITION OF GOD  AND THAT SOUL WAS A
PROJECTION OF THE CHARACTER OF GOD AND WHEN HE CALLED ME HIS SWEET
METAPHYSICIAN  I CALLED HIM MY IMMORTAL MATERIALIST  AND SO WE LOVED AND
WERE HAPPY AND I FORGAVE HIM HIS MATERIALISM BECAUSE OF HIS TREMENDOUS
WORK IN THE WORLD  PERFORMED WITHOUT THOUGHT OF SOULGAIN THEREBY  AND
BECAUSE OF HIS SO EXCEEDING MODESTY OF SPIRIT THAT PREVENTED HIM FROM
HAVING PRIDE AND REGAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIMSELF AND HIS SOUL 

BUT HE HAD PRIDE  HOW COULD HE HAVE BEEN AN EAGLE AND NOT HAVE PRIDE
HIS CONTENTION WAS THAT IT WAS FINER FOR A FINITE MORTAL SPECK OF LIFE
TO FEEL GODLIKE  THAN FOR A GOD TO FEEL GODLIKE AND SO IT WAS THAT HE
EXALTED WHAT HE DEEMED HIS MORTALITY  HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT
FROM A CERTAIN POEM  HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE WHOLE POEM  AND HE HAD TRIED
VAINLY TO LEARN ITS AUTHORSHIP  I HERE GIVE THE FRAGMENT  NOT ALONE
BECAUSE HE LOVED IT  BUT BECAUSE IT EPITOMIZED THE PARADOX THAT HE WAS
IN THE SPIRIT OF HIM  AND HIS CONCEPTION OF HIS SPIRIT  FOR HOW CAN A
MAN  WITH THRILLING  AND BURNING  AND EXALTATION  RECITE THE FOLLOWING
AND STILL BE MERE MORTAL EARTH  A BIT OF FUGITIVE FORCE  AN EVANESCENT
FORM HERE IT IS 

     JOY UPON JOY AND GAIN UPON GAIN
     ARE THE DESTINED RIGHTS OF MY BIRTH 
     AND I SHOUT THE PRAISE OF MY ENDLESS DAYS
     TO THE ECHOING EDGE OF THE EARTH 
     THOUGH I SUFFER ALL DEATHS THAT A MAN CAN DIE
     TO THE UTTERMOST END OF TIME 
     I HAVE DEEPDRAINED THIS  MY CUP OF BLISS 
     IN EVERY AGE AND CLIME

     THE FROTH OF PRIDE  THE TANG OF POWER 
     THE SWEET OF WOMANHOOD
     I DRAIN THE LEES UPON MY KNEES 
     FOR OH  THE DRAUGHT IS GOOD
     I DRINK TO LIFE  I DRINK TO DEATH 
     AND SMACK MY LIPS WITH SONG 
     FOR WHEN I DIE  ANOTHER I SHALL PASS THE CUP ALONG 

     THE MAN YOU DROVE FROM EDENS GROVE
              WAS I  MY LORD  WAS I 
     AND I SHALL BE THERE WHEN THE EARTH AND THE AIR
              ARE RENT FROM SEA TO SKY
     FOR IT IS MY WORLD  MY GORGEOUS WORLD 
              THE WORLD OF MY DEAREST WOES 
     FROM THE FIRST FAINT CRY OF THE NEWBORN
              TO THE RACK OF THE WOMANS THROES 

     PACKED WITH THE PULSE OF AN UNBORN RACE 
     TORN WITH A WORLDS DESIRE 
     THE SURGING FLOOD OF MY WILD YOUNG BLOOD
     WOULD QUENCH THE JUDGMENT FIRE 
     I AM MAN  MAN  MAN  FROM THE TINGLING FLESH
     TO THE DUST OF MY EARTHLY GOAL 
     FROM THE NESTLING GLOOM OF THE PREGNANT WOMB
     TO THE SHEEN OF MY NAKED SOUL 
     BONE OF MY BONE AND FLESH OF MY FLESH
     THE WHOLE WORLD LEAPS TO MY WILL 
     AND THE UNSLAKED THIRST OF AN EDEN CURSED
     SHALL HARROW THE EARTH FOR ITS FILL 
     ALMIGHTY GOD  WHEN I DRAIN LIFES GLASS
     OF ALL ITS RAINBOW GLEAMS 
     THE HAPLESS PLIGHT OF ETERNAL NIGHT
     SHALL BE NONE TOO LONG FOR MY DREAMS 

     THE MAN YOU DROVE FROM EDENS GROVE
              WAS I  MY LORD  WAS I 
     AND I SHALL BE THERE WHEN THE EARTH AND THE AIR
              ARE RENT FROM SEA TO SKY
     FOR IT IS MY WORLD  MY GORGEOUS WORLD 
              THE WORLD OF MY DEAR DELIGHT 
     FROM THE BRIGHTEST GLEAM OF THE ARCTIC STREAM
              TO THE DUSK OF MY OWN LOVENIGHT 

ERNEST ALWAYS OVERWORKED  HIS WONDERFUL CONSTITUTION KEPT HIM UP BUT
EVEN THAT CONSTITUTION COULD NOT KEEP THE TIRED LOOK OUT OF HIS EYES 
HIS DEAR  TIRED EYES HE NEVER SLEPT MORE THAN FOUR AND ONEHALF HOURS
A NIGHT YET HE NEVER FOUND TIME TO DO ALL THE WORK HE WANTED TO DO 
HE NEVER CEASED FROM HIS ACTIVITIES AS A PROPAGANDIST  AND WAS ALWAYS
SCHEDULED LONG IN ADVANCE FOR LECTURES TO WORKINGMENS ORGANIZATIONS 
THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN  HE DID A MANS FULL WORK IN THAT ALONE 
WITH THE SUPPRESSION OF THE SOCIALIST PUBLISHING HOUSES  HIS MEAGRE
ROYALTIES CEASED  AND HE WAS HARDPUT TO MAKE A LIVING FOR HE HAD TO
MAKE A LIVING IN ADDITION TO ALL HIS OTHER LABOR  HE DID A GREAT DEAL
OF TRANSLATING FOR THE MAGAZINES ON SCIENTIFIC AND PHILOSOPHIC SUBJECTS
AND  COMING HOME LATE AT NIGHT  WORN OUT FROM THE STRAIN OF THE
CAMPAIGN  HE WOULD PLUNGE INTO HIS TRANSLATING AND TOIL ON WELL INTO THE
MORNING HOURS  AND IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING  THERE WAS HIS STUDYING 
TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH HE KEPT UP HIS STUDIES  AND HE STUDIED
PRODIGIOUSLY 

AND YET HE FOUND TIME IN WHICH TO LOVE ME AND MAKE ME HAPPY  BUT THIS
WAS ACCOMPLISHED ONLY THROUGH MY MERGING MY LIFE COMPLETELY INTO HIS  I
LEARNED SHORTHAND AND TYPEWRITING  AND BECAME HIS SECRETARY  HE INSISTED
THAT I SUCCEEDED IN CUTTING HIS WORK IN HALF AND SO IT WAS THAT I
SCHOOLED MYSELF TO UNDERSTAND HIS WORK  OUR INTERESTS BECAME MUTUAL  AND
WE WORKED TOGETHER AND PLAYED TOGETHER 

AND THEN THERE WERE OUR SWEET STOLEN MOMENTS IN THE MIDST OF OUR
WORKJUST A WORD  OR CARESS  OR FLASH OF LOVELIGHT AND OUR MOMENTS
WERE SWEETER FOR BEING STOLEN  FOR WE LIVED ON THE HEIGHTS  WHERE THE
AIR WAS KEEN AND SPARKLING  WHERE THE TOIL WAS FOR HUMANITY  AND WHERE
SORDIDNESS AND SELFISHNESS NEVER ENTERED  WE LOVED LOVE  AND OUR LOVE
WAS NEVER SMIRCHED BY ANYTHING LESS THAN THE BEST  AND THIS OUT OF ALL
REMAINS  I DID NOT FAIL  I GAVE HIM RESTHE WHO WORKED SO HARD FOR
OTHERS  MY DEAR  TIREDEYED MORTALIST 



CHAPTER XII

THE BISHOP


IT WAS AFTER MY MARRIAGE THAT I CHANCED UPON BISHOP MOREHOUSE  BUT I
MUST GIVE THE EVENTS IN THEIR PROPER SEQUENCE  AFTER HIS OUTBREAK AT THE
I  P  H  CONVENTION  THE BISHOP  BEING A GENTLE SOUL  HAD YIELDED TO
THE FRIENDLY PRESSURE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON HIM  AND HAD GONE AWAY ON A
VACATION  BUT HE RETURNED MORE FIXED THAN EVER IN HIS DETERMINATION
TO PREACH THE MESSAGE OF THE CHURCH  TO THE CONSTERNATION OF HIS
CONGREGATION  HIS FIRST SERMON WAS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE ADDRESS HE
HAD GIVEN BEFORE THE CONVENTION  AGAIN HE SAID  AND AT LENGTH AND WITH
DISTRESSING DETAIL  THAT THE CHURCH HAD WANDERED AWAY FROM THE MASTERS
TEACHING  AND THAT MAMMON HAD BEEN INSTATED IN THE PLACE OF CHRIST 

AND THE RESULT WAS  WILLYNILLY  THAT HE WAS LED AWAY TO A PRIVATE
SANITARIUM FOR MENTAL DISEASE  WHILE IN THE NEWSPAPERS APPEARED
PATHETIC ACCOUNTS OF HIS MENTAL BREAKDOWN AND OF THE SAINTLINESS OF
HIS CHARACTER  HE WAS HELD A PRISONER IN THE SANITARIUM  I CALLED
REPEATEDLY  BUT WAS DENIED ACCESS TO HIM AND I WAS TERRIBLY IMPRESSED
BY THE TRAGEDY OF A SANE  NORMAL  SAINTLY MAN BEING CRUSHED BY THE
BRUTAL WILL OF SOCIETY  FOR THE BISHOP WAS SANE  AND PURE  AND NOBLE  AS
ERNEST SAID  ALL THAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM WAS THAT HE HAD INCORRECT
NOTIONS OF BIOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY  AND BECAUSE OF HIS INCORRECT NOTIONS
HE HAD NOT GONE ABOUT IT IN THE RIGHT WAY TO RECTIFY MATTERS 

WHAT TERRIFIED ME WAS THE BISHOPS HELPLESSNESS  IF HE PERSISTED IN THE
TRUTH AS HE SAW IT  HE WAS DOOMED TO AN INSANE WARD  AND HE COULD DO
NOTHING  HIS MONEY  HIS POSITION  HIS CULTURE  COULD NOT SAVE HIM  HIS
VIEWS WERE PERILOUS TO SOCIETY  AND SOCIETY COULD NOT CONCEIVE THAT SUCH
PERILOUS VIEWS COULD BE THE PRODUCT OF A SANE MIND  OR  AT LEAST  IT
SEEMS TO ME THAT SUCH WAS SOCIETYS ATTITUDE 

BUT THE BISHOP  IN SPITE OF THE GENTLENESS AND PURITY OF HIS SPIRIT  WAS
POSSESSED OF GUILE  HE APPREHENDED CLEARLY HIS DANGER  HE SAW HIMSELF
CAUGHT IN THE WEB  AND HE TRIED TO ESCAPE FROM IT  DENIED HELP FROM HIS
FRIENDS  SUCH AS FATHER AND ERNEST AND I COULD HAVE GIVEN  HE WAS
LEFT TO BATTLE FOR HIMSELF ALONE  AND IN THE ENFORCED SOLITUDE OF THE
SANITARIUM HE RECOVERED  HE BECAME AGAIN SANE  HIS EYES CEASED TO SEE
VISIONS HIS BRAIN WAS PURGED OF THE FANCY THAT IT WAS THE DUTY OF
SOCIETY TO FEED THE MASTERS LAMBS 

AS I SAY  HE BECAME WELL  QUITE WELL  AND THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE CHURCH
PEOPLE HAILED HIS RETURN WITH JOY  I WENT ONCE TO HIS CHURCH  THE SERMON
WAS OF THE SAME ORDER AS THE ONES HE HAD PREACHED LONG BEFORE HIS EYES
HAD SEEN VISIONS  I WAS DISAPPOINTED  SHOCKED  HAD SOCIETY THEN BEATEN
HIM INTO SUBMISSION WAS HE A COWARD HAD HE BEEN BULLDOZED INTO
RECANTING OR HAD THE STRAIN BEEN TOO GREAT FOR HIM  AND HAD HE MEEKLY
SURRENDERED TO THE JUGGERNAUT OF THE ESTABLISHED

I CALLED UPON HIM IN HIS BEAUTIFUL HOME  HE WAS WOEFULLY CHANGED  HE WAS
THINNER  AND THERE WERE LINES ON HIS FACE WHICH I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE 
HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING  HE PLUCKED NERVOUSLY AT HIS
SLEEVE AS WE TALKED AND HIS EYES WERE RESTLESS  FLUTTERING HERE  THERE 
AND EVERYWHERE  AND REFUSING TO MEET MINE  HIS MIND SEEMED PREOCCUPIED 
AND THERE WERE STRANGE PAUSES IN HIS CONVERSATION  ABRUPT CHANGES OF
TOPIC  AND AN INCONSECUTIVENESS THAT WAS BEWILDERING  COULD THIS  THEN 
BE THE FIRMPOISED  CHRISTLIKE MAN I HAD KNOWN  WITH PURE  LIMPID EYES
AND A GAZE STEADY AND UNFALTERING AS HIS SOUL HE HAD BEEN MANHANDLED
HE HAD BEEN COWED INTO SUBJECTION  HIS SPIRIT WAS TOO GENTLE  IT HAD NOT
BEEN MIGHTY ENOUGH TO FACE THE ORGANIZED WOLFPACK OF SOCIETY 

I FELT SAD  UNUTTERABLY SAD  HE TALKED AMBIGUOUSLY  AND WAS SO
APPREHENSIVE OF WHAT I MIGHT SAY THAT I HAD NOT THE HEART TO CATECHISE
HIM  HE SPOKE IN A FARAWAY MANNER OF HIS ILLNESS  AND WE TALKED
DISJOINTEDLY ABOUT THE CHURCH  THE ALTERATIONS IN THE ORGAN  AND ABOUT
PETTY CHARITIES AND HE SAW ME DEPART WITH SUCH EVIDENT RELIEF THAT I
SHOULD HAVE LAUGHED HAD NOT MY HEART BEEN SO FULL OF TEARS 

THE POOR LITTLE HERO IF I HAD ONLY KNOWN HE WAS BATTLING LIKE A GIANT 
AND I DID NOT GUESS IT  ALONE  ALL ALONE  IN THE MIDST OF MILLIONS OF
HIS FELLOWMEN  HE WAS FIGHTING HIS FIGHT  TORN BY HIS HORROR OF THE
ASYLUM AND HIS FIDELITY TO TRUTH AND THE RIGHT  HE CLUNG STEADFASTLY TO
TRUTH AND THE RIGHT BUT SO ALONE WAS HE THAT HE DID NOT DARE TO TRUST
EVEN ME  HE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON WELLTOO WELL 

BUT I WAS SOON TO KNOW  ONE DAY THE BISHOP DISAPPEARED  HE HAD TOLD
NOBODY THAT HE WAS GOING AWAY AND AS THE DAYS WENT BY AND HE DID NOT
REAPPEAR  THERE WAS MUCH GOSSIP TO THE EFFECT THAT HE HAD COMMITTED
SUICIDE WHILE TEMPORARILY DERANGED  BUT THIS IDEA WAS DISPELLED WHEN IT
WAS LEARNED THAT HE HAD SOLD ALL HIS POSSESSIONS HIS CITY MANSION  HIS
COUNTRY HOUSE AT MENLO PARK  HIS PAINTINGS  AND COLLECTIONS  AND EVEN
HIS CHERISHED LIBRARY  IT WAS PATENT THAT HE HAD MADE A CLEAN AND SECRET
SWEEP OF EVERYTHING BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED 

THIS HAPPENED DURING THE TIME WHEN CALAMITY HAD OVERTAKEN US IN OUR OWN
AFFAIRS AND IT WAS NOT TILL WE WERE WELL SETTLED IN OUR NEW HOME THAT
WE HAD OPPORTUNITY REALLY TO WONDER AND SPECULATE ABOUT THE BISHOPS
DOINGS  AND THEN  EVERYTHING WAS SUDDENLY MADE CLEAR  EARLY ONE EVENING 
WHILE IT WAS YET TWILIGHT  I HAD RUN ACROSS THE STREET AND INTO THE
BUTCHERSHOP TO GET SOME CHOPS FOR ERNESTS SUPPER  WE CALLED THE LAST
MEAL OF THE DAY SUPPER IN OUR NEW ENVIRONMENT 

JUST AT THE MOMENT I CAME OUT OF THE BUTCHERSHOP  A MAN EMERGED FROM
THE CORNER GROCERY THAT STOOD ALONGSIDE  A QUEER SENSE FAMILIARITY MADE
ME LOOK AGAIN  BUT THE MAN HAD TURNED AND WAS WALKING RAPIDLY AWAY 
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE SLOPE OF THE SHOULDERS AND THE FRINGE
OF SILVER HAIR BETWEEN COAT COLLAR AND SLOUCH HAT THAT AROUSED VAGUE
MEMORIES  INSTEAD OF CROSSING THE STREET  I HURRIED AFTER THE MAN  I
QUICKENED MY PACE  TRYING NOT TO THINK THE THOUGHTS THAT FORMED UNBIDDEN
IN MY BRAIN  NO  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE  IT COULD NOT BENOT IN THOSE FADED
OVERALLS  TOO LONG IN THE LEGS AND FRAYED AT THE BOTTOMS 

I PAUSED  LAUGHED AT MYSELF  AND ALMOST ABANDONED THE CHASE  BUT THE
HAUNTING FAMILIARITY OF THOSE SHOULDERS AND THAT SILVER HAIR AGAIN
I HURRIED ON  AS I PASSED HIM  I SHOT A KEEN LOOK AT HIS FACE THEN I
WHIRLED AROUND ABRUPTLY AND CONFRONTEDTHE BISHOP 

HE HALTED WITH EQUAL ABRUPTNESS  AND GASPED  A LARGE PAPER BAG IN HIS
RIGHT HAND FELL TO THE SIDEWALK  IT BURST  AND ABOUT HIS FEET AND MINE
BOUNCED AND ROLLED A FLOOD OF POTATOES  HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SURPRISE
AND ALARM  THEN HE SEEMED TO WILT AWAY THE SHOULDERS DROOPED WITH
DEJECTION  AND HE UTTERED A DEEP SIGH 

I HELD OUT MY HAND  HE SHOOK IT  BUT HIS HAND FELT CLAMMY  HE CLEARED
HIS THROAT IN EMBARRASSMENT  AND I COULD SEE THE SWEAT STARTING OUT ON
HIS FOREHEAD  IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS BADLY FRIGHTENED 

THE POTATOES  HE MURMURED FAINTLY  THEY ARE PRECIOUS 

BETWEEN US WE PICKED THEM UP AND REPLACED THEM IN THE BROKEN BAG  WHICH
HE NOW HELD CAREFULLY IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM  I TRIED TO TELL HIM MY
GLADNESS AT MEETING HIM AND THAT HE MUST COME RIGHT HOME WITH ME 

FATHER WILL BE REJOICED TO SEE YOU  I SAID  WE LIVE ONLY A STONES
THROW AWAY 

I CANT  HE SAID  I MUST BE GOING  GOODBY 

HE LOOKED APPREHENSIVELY ABOUT HIM  AS THOUGH DREADING DISCOVERY  AND
MADE AN ATTEMPT TO WALK ON 

TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE  AND I SHALL CALL LATER  HE SAID  WHEN HE SAW
THAT I WALKED BESIDE HIM AND THAT IT WAS MY INTENTION TO STICK TO HIM
NOW THAT HE WAS FOUND 

NO  I ANSWERED FIRMLY  YOU MUST COME NOW 

HE LOOKED AT THE POTATOES SPILLING ON HIS ARM  AND AT THE SMALL PARCELS
ON HIS OTHER ARM 

REALLY  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE  HE SAID  FORGIVE ME FOR MY RUDENESS  IF YOU
ONLY KNEW 

HE LOOKED AS IF HE WERE GOING TO BREAK DOWN  BUT THE NEXT MOMENT HE HAD
HIMSELF IN CONTROL 

BESIDES  THIS FOOD  HE WENT ON  IT IS A SAD CASE  IT IS TERRIBLE  SHE
IS AN OLD WOMAN  I MUST TAKE IT TO HER AT ONCE  SHE IS SUFFERING FROM
WANT OF IT  I MUST GO AT ONCE  YOU UNDERSTAND  THEN I WILL RETURN  I
PROMISE YOU 

LET ME GO WITH YOU  I VOLUNTEERED  IS IT FAR

HE SIGHED AGAIN  AND SURRENDERED 

ONLY TWO BLOCKS  HE SAID  LET US HASTEN 

UNDER THE BISHOPS GUIDANCE I LEARNED SOMETHING OF MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD 
I HAD NOT DREAMED SUCH WRETCHEDNESS AND MISERY EXISTED IN IT  OF COURSE 
THIS WAS BECAUSE I DID NOT CONCERN MYSELF WITH CHARITY  I HAD BECOME
CONVINCED THAT ERNEST WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SNEERED AT CHARITY AS A
POULTICING OF AN ULCER  REMOVE THE ULCER  WAS HIS REMEDY GIVE TO THE
WORKER HIS PRODUCT PENSION AS SOLDIERS THOSE WHO GROW HONORABLY OLD IN
THEIR TOIL  AND THERE WILL BE NO NEED FOR CHARITY  CONVINCED OF THIS 
I TOILED WITH HIM AT THE REVOLUTION  AND DID NOT EXHAUST MY ENERGY IN
ALLEVIATING THE SOCIAL ILLS THAT CONTINUOUSLY AROSE FROM THE INJUSTICE
OF THE SYSTEM 

I FOLLOWED THE BISHOP INTO A SMALL ROOM  TEN BY TWELVE  IN A REAR
TENEMENT  AND THERE WE FOUND A LITTLE OLD GERMAN WOMANSIXTYFOUR YEARS
OLD  THE BISHOP SAID  SHE WAS SURPRISED AT SEEING ME  BUT SHE NODDED A
PLEASANT GREETING AND WENT ON SEWING ON THE PAIR OF MENS TROUSERS IN
HER LAP  BESIDE HER  ON THE FLOOR  WAS A PILE OF TROUSERS  THE BISHOP
DISCOVERED THERE WAS NEITHER COAL NOR KINDLING  AND WENT OUT TO BUY
SOME 

I TOOK UP A PAIR OF TROUSERS AND EXAMINED HER WORK 

SIX CENTS  LADY  SHE SAID  NODDING HER HEAD GENTLY WHILE SHE WENT ON
STITCHING  SHE STITCHED SLOWLY  BUT NEVER DID SHE CEASE FROM STITCHING 
SHE SEEMED MASTERED BY THE VERB TO STITCH 

FOR ALL THAT WORK I ASKED  IS THAT WHAT THEY PAY HOW LONG DOES IT
TAKE YOU

YES  SHE ANSWERED  THAT IS WHAT THEY PAY  SIX CENTS FOR FINISHING 
TWO HOURS SEWING ON EACH PAIR 

BUT THE BOSS DOESNT KNOW THAT  SHE ADDED QUICKLY  BETRAYING A FEAR
OF GETTING HIM INTO TROUBLE  IM SLOW  IVE GOT THE RHEUMATISM IN MY
HANDS  GIRLS WORK MUCH FASTER  THEY FINISH IN HALF THAT TIME  THE BOSS
IS KIND  HE LETS ME TAKE THE WORK HOME  NOW THAT I AM OLD AND THE NOISE
OF THE MACHINE BOTHERS MY HEAD  IF IT WASNT FOR HIS KINDNESS  ID
STARVE 

YES  THOSE WHO WORK IN THE SHOP GET EIGHT CENTS  BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH WORK FOR THE YOUNG  THE OLD HAVE NO CHANCE  OFTEN
ONE PAIR IS ALL I CAN GET  SOMETIMES  LIKE TODAY  I AM GIVEN EIGHT PAIR
TO FINISH BEFORE NIGHT 

I ASKED HER THE HOURS SHE WORKED  AND SHE SAID IT DEPENDED ON THE
SEASON 

IN THE SUMMER  WHEN THERE IS A RUSH ORDER  I WORK FROM FIVE IN THE
MORNING TO NINE AT NIGHT  BUT IN THE WINTER IT IS TOO COLD  THE HANDS DO
NOT EARLY GET OVER THE STIFFNESS  THEN YOU MUST WORK LATERTILL AFTER
MIDNIGHT SOMETIMES 

YES  IT HAS BEEN A BAD SUMMER  THE HARD TIMES  GOD MUST BE ANGRY 
THIS IS THE FIRST WORK THE BOSS HAS GIVEN ME IN A WEEK  IT IS TRUE  ONE
CANNOT EAT MUCH WHEN THERE IS NO WORK  I AM USED TO IT  I HAVE SEWED
ALL MY LIFE  IN THE OLD COUNTRY AND HERE IN SAN FRANCISCOTHIRTYTHREE
YEARS 

IF YOU ARE SURE OF THE RENT  IT IS ALL RIGHT  THE HOUSEMAN IS VERY
KIND  BUT HE MUST HAVE HIS RENT  IT IS FAIR  HE ONLY CHARGES THREE
DOLLARS FOR THIS ROOM  THAT IS CHEAP  BUT IT IS NOT EASY FOR YOU TO FIND
ALL OF THREE DOLLARS EVERY MONTH 

SHE CEASED TALKING  AND  NODDING HER HEAD  WENT ON STITCHING 

YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL AS TO HOW YOU SPEND YOUR EARNINGS  I
SUGGESTED 

SHE NODDED EMPHATICALLY 

AFTER THE RENT ITS NOT SO BAD  OF COURSE YOU CANT BUY MEAT  AND THERE
IS NO MILK FOR THE COFFEE  BUT ALWAYS THERE IS ONE MEAL A DAY  AND OFTEN
TWO 

SHE SAID THIS LAST PROUDLY  THERE WAS A SMACK OF SUCCESS IN HER WORDS 
BUT AS SHE STITCHED ON IN SILENCE  I NOTICED THE SADNESS IN HER PLEASANT
EYES AND THE DROOP OF HER MOUTH  THE LOOK IN HER EYES BECAME FAR AWAY 
SHE RUBBED THE DIMNESS HASTILY OUT OF THEM IT INTERFERED WITH HER
STITCHING 

NO  IT IS NOT THE HUNGER THAT MAKES THE HEART ACHE  SHE EXPLAINED 
YOU GET USED TO BEING HUNGRY  IT IS FOR MY CHILD THAT I CRY  IT WAS
THE MACHINE THAT KILLED HER  IT IS TRUE SHE WORKED HARD  BUT I CANNOT
UNDERSTAND  SHE WAS STRONG  AND SHE WAS YOUNGONLY FORTY AND SHE
WORKED ONLY THIRTY YEARS  SHE BEGAN YOUNG  IT IS TRUE BUT MY MAN DIED 
THE BOILER EXPLODED DOWN AT THE WORKS  AND WHAT WERE WE TO DO SHE WAS
TEN  BUT SHE WAS VERY STRONG  BUT THE MACHINE KILLED HER  YES  IT
DID  IT KILLED HER  AND SHE WAS THE FASTEST WORKER IN THE SHOP  I HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT IT OFTEN  AND I KNOW  THAT IS WHY I CANNOT WORK IN THE
SHOP  THE MACHINE BOTHERS MY HEAD  ALWAYS I HEAR IT SAYING  I DID IT  I
DID IT  AND IT SAYS THAT ALL DAY LONG  AND THEN I THINK OF MY DAUGHTER 
AND I CANNOT WORK 

THE MOISTNESS WAS IN HER OLD EYES AGAIN  AND SHE HAD TO WIPE IT AWAY
BEFORE SHE COULD GO ON STITCHING 

I HEARD THE BISHOP STUMBLING UP THE STAIRS  AND I OPENED THE DOOR  WHAT
A SPECTACLE HE WAS  ON HIS BACK HE CARRIED HALF A SACK OF COAL  WITH
KINDLING ON TOP  SOME OF THE COAL DUST HAD COATED HIS FACE  AND THE
SWEAT FROM HIS EXERTIONS WAS RUNNING IN STREAKS  HE DROPPED HIS BURDEN
IN THE CORNER BY THE STOVE AND WIPED HIS FACE ON A COARSE BANDANA
HANDKERCHIEF  I COULD SCARCELY ACCEPT THE VERDICT OF MY SENSES  THE
BISHOP  BLACK AS A COALHEAVER  IN A WORKINGMANS CHEAP COTTON SHIRT
ONE BUTTON WAS MISSING FROM THE THROAT  AND IN OVERALLS THAT WAS THE
MOST INCONGRUOUS OF ALLTHE OVERALLS  FRAYED AT THE BOTTOMS  DRAGGED
DOWN AT THE HEELS  AND HELD UP BY A NARROW LEATHER BELT AROUND THE HIPS
SUCH AS LABORERS WEAR 

THOUGH THE BISHOP WAS WARM  THE POOR SWOLLEN HANDS OF THE OLD WOMAN WERE
ALREADY CRAMPING WITH THE COLD AND BEFORE WE LEFT HER  THE BISHOP HAD
BUILT THE FIRE  WHILE I HAD PEELED THE POTATOES AND PUT THEM ON TO BOIL 
I WAS TO LEARN  AS TIME WENT BY  THAT THERE WERE MANY CASES SIMILAR
TO HERS  AND MANY WORSE  HIDDEN AWAY IN THE MONSTROUS DEPTHS OF THE
TENEMENTS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD 

WE GOT BACK TO FIND ERNEST ALARMED BY MY ABSENCE  AFTER THE FIRST
SURPRISE OF GREETING WAS OVER  THE BISHOP LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR 
STRETCHED OUT HIS OVERALLCOVERED LEGS  AND ACTUALLY SIGHED A
COMFORTABLE SIGH  WE WERE THE FIRST OF HIS OLD FRIENDS HE HAD MET SINCE
HIS DISAPPEARANCE  HE TOLD US AND DURING THE INTERVENING WEEKS HE MUST
HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY FROM LONELINESS  HE TOLD US MUCH  THOUGH HE TOLD
US MORE OF THE JOY HE HAD EXPERIENCED IN DOING THE MASTERS BIDDING 

FOR TRULY NOW  HE SAID  I AM FEEDING HIS LAMBS  AND I HAVE LEARNED
A GREAT LESSON  THE SOUL CANNOT BE MINISTERED TO TILL THE STOMACH IS
APPEASED  HIS LAMBS MUST BE FED BREAD AND BUTTER AND POTATOES AND
MEAT AFTER THAT  AND ONLY AFTER THAT  ARE THEIR SPIRITS READY FOR MORE
REFINED NOURISHMENT 

HE ATE HEARTILY OF THE SUPPER I COOKED  NEVER HAD HE HAD SUCH AN
APPETITE AT OUR TABLE IN THE OLD DAYS  WE SPOKE OF IT  AND HE SAID THAT
HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO HEALTHY IN HIS LIFE 

I WALK ALWAYS NOW  HE SAID  AND A BLUSH WAS ON HIS CHEEK AT THE
THOUGHT OF THE TIME WHEN HE RODE IN HIS CARRIAGE  AS THOUGH IT WERE A
SIN NOT LIGHTLY TO BE LAID 

MY HEALTH IS BETTER FOR IT  HE ADDED HASTILY  AND I AM VERY
HAPPYINDEED  MOST HAPPY  AT LAST I AM A CONSECRATED SPIRIT 

AND YET THERE WAS IN HIS FACE A PERMANENT PAIN  THE PAIN OF THE WORLD
THAT HE WAS NOW TAKING TO HIMSELF  HE WAS SEEING LIFE IN THE RAW  AND IT
WAS A DIFFERENT LIFE FROM WHAT HE HAD KNOWN WITHIN THE PRINTED BOOKS OF
HIS LIBRARY 

AND YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THIS  YOUNG MAN  HE SAID DIRECTLY TO
ERNEST 

ERNEST WAS EMBARRASSED AND AWKWARD 

II WARNED YOU  HE FALTERED 

NO  YOU MISUNDERSTAND  THE BISHOP ANSWERED  I SPEAK NOT IN REPROACH 
BUT IN GRATITUDE  I HAVE YOU TO THANK FOR SHOWING ME MY PATH  YOU LED ME
FROM THEORIES ABOUT LIFE TO LIFE ITSELF  YOU PULLED ASIDE THE VEILS FROM
THE SOCIAL SHAMS  YOU WERE LIGHT IN MY DARKNESS  BUT NOW I  TOO  SEE THE
LIGHT  AND I AM VERY HAPPY  ONLY       HE HESITATED PAINFULLY  AND IN
HIS EYES FEAR LEAPED LARGE  ONLY THE PERSECUTION  I HARM NO ONE  WHY
WILL THEY NOT LET ME ALONE BUT IT IS NOT THAT  IT IS THE NATURE OF
THE PERSECUTION  I SHOULDNT MIND IF THEY CUT MY FLESH WITH STRIPES  OR
BURNED ME AT THE STAKE  OR CRUCIFIED ME HEADDOWNWARD  BUT IT IS THE
ASYLUM THAT FRIGHTENS ME  THINK OF IT OF MEIN AN ASYLUM FOR THE
INSANE IT IS REVOLTING  I SAW SOME OF THE CASES AT THE SANITARIUM  THEY
WERE VIOLENT  MY BLOOD CHILLS WHEN I THINK OF IT  AND TO BE IMPRISONED
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AMID SCENES OF SCREAMING MADNESS NO NO NOT
THAT NOT THAT

IT WAS PITIFUL  HIS HANDS SHOOK  HIS WHOLE BODY QUIVERED AND SHRANK AWAY
FROM THE PICTURE HE HAD CONJURED  BUT THE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS CALM 

FORGIVE ME  HE SAID SIMPLY  IT IS MY WRETCHED NERVES  AND IF THE
MASTERS WORK LEADS THERE  SO BE IT  WHO AM I TO COMPLAIN

I FELT LIKE CRYING ALOUD AS I LOOKED AT HIM  GREAT BISHOP O HERO
GODS HERO

AS THE EVENING WORE ON WE LEARNED MORE OF HIS DOINGS 

I SOLD MY HOUSEMY HOUSES  RATHER  HE SAID  ALL MY OTHER POSSESSIONS 
I KNEW I MUST DO IT SECRETLY  ELSE THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN EVERYTHING AWAY
FROM ME  THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE  I OFTEN MARVEL THESE DAYS AT THE
IMMENSE QUANTITY OF POTATOES TWO OR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WILL
BUY  OR BREAD  OR MEAT  OR COAL AND KINDLING  HE TURNED TO ERNEST  YOU
ARE RIGHT  YOUNG MAN  LABOR IS DREADFULLY UNDERPAID  I NEVER DID A
BIT OF WORK IN MY LIFE  EXCEPT TO APPEAL AESTHETICALLY TO PHARISEESI
THOUGHT I WAS PREACHING THE MESSAGEAND YET I WAS WORTH HALF A MILLION
DOLLARS  I NEVER KNEW WHAT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS MEANT UNTIL I REALIZED
HOW MUCH POTATOES AND BREAD AND BUTTER AND MEAT IT COULD BUY  AND THEN
I REALIZED SOMETHING MORE  I REALIZED THAT ALL THOSE POTATOES AND THAT
BREAD AND BUTTER AND MEAT WERE MINE  AND THAT I HAD NOT WORKED TO MAKE
THEM  THEN IT WAS CLEAR TO ME  SOME ONE ELSE HAD WORKED AND MADE THEM
AND BEEN ROBBED OF THEM  AND WHEN I CAME DOWN AMONGST THE POOR I FOUND
THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ROBBED AND WHO WERE HUNGRY AND WRETCHED BECAUSE THEY
HAD BEEN ROBBED 

WE DREW HIM BACK TO HIS NARRATIVE 

THE MONEY I HAVE IT DEPOSITED IN MANY DIFFERENT BANKS UNDER DIFFERENT
NAMES  IT CAN NEVER BE TAKEN AWAY FROM ME  BECAUSE IT CAN NEVER BE
FOUND  AND IT IS SO GOOD  THAT MONEY  IT BUYS SO MUCH FOOD  I NEVER KNEW
BEFORE WHAT MONEY WAS GOOD FOR 

I WISH WE COULD GET SOME OF IT FOR THE PROPAGANDA  ERNEST SAID
WISTFULLY  IT WOULD DO IMMENSE GOOD 

DO YOU THINK SO THE BISHOP SAID  I DO NOT HAVE MUCH FAITH IN
POLITICS  IN FACT  I AM AFRAID I DO NOT UNDERSTAND POLITICS 

ERNEST WAS DELICATE IN SUCH MATTERS  HE DID NOT REPEAT HIS SUGGESTION 
THOUGH HE KNEW ONLY TOO WELL THE SORE STRAITS THE SOCIALIST PARTY WAS IN
THROUGH LACK OF MONEY 

I SLEEP IN CHEAP LODGING HOUSES  THE BISHOP WENT ON  BUT I AM AFRAID 
AND NEVER STAY LONG IN ONE PLACE  ALSO  I RENT TWO ROOMS IN WORKINGMENS
HOUSES IN DIFFERENT QUARTERS OF THE CITY  IT IS A GREAT EXTRAVAGANCE 
I KNOW  BUT IT IS NECESSARY  I MAKE UP FOR IT IN PART BY DOING MY OWN
COOKING  THOUGH SOMETIMES I GET SOMETHING TO EAT IN CHEAP COFFEEHOUSES 
AND I HAVE MADE A DISCOVERY  TAMALES ARE VERY GOOD WHEN THE AIR GROWS
CHILLY LATE AT NIGHT  ONLY THEY ARE SO EXPENSIVE  BUT I HAVE DISCOVERED
A PLACE WHERE I CAN GET THREE FOR TEN CENTS  THEY ARE NOT SO GOOD AS THE
OTHERS  BUT THEY ARE VERY WARMING 

      A MEXICAN DISH  REFERRED TO OCCASIONALLY IN THE LITERATURE
     OF THE TIMES   IT IS SUPPOSED THAT IT WAS WARMLY SEASONED 
     NO RECIPE OF IT HAS COME DOWN TO US 

AND SO I HAVE AT LAST FOUND MY WORK IN THE WORLD  THANKS TO YOU  YOUNG
MAN  IT IS THE MASTERS WORK  HE LOOKED AT ME  AND HIS EYES TWINKLED 
YOU CAUGHT ME FEEDING HIS LAMBS  YOU KNOW  AND OF COURSE YOU WILL ALL
KEEP MY SECRET 

HE SPOKE CARELESSLY ENOUGH  BUT THERE WAS REAL FEAR BEHIND THE SPEECH 
HE PROMISED TO CALL UPON US AGAIN  BUT A WEEK LATER WE READ IN THE
NEWSPAPER OF THE SAD CASE OF BISHOP MOREHOUSE  WHO HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO
THE NAPA ASYLUM AND FOR WHOM THERE WERE STILL HOPES HELD OUT  IN VAIN
WE TRIED TO SEE HIM  TO HAVE HIS CASE RECONSIDERED OR INVESTIGATED  NOR
COULD WE LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT HIM EXCEPT THE REITERATED STATEMENTS THAT
SLIGHT HOPES WERE STILL HELD FOR HIS RECOVERY 

CHRIST TOLD THE RICH YOUNG MAN TO SELL ALL HE HAD  ERNEST SAID
BITTERLY  THE BISHOP OBEYED CHRISTS INJUNCTION AND GOT LOCKED UP IN A
MADHOUSE  TIMES HAVE CHANGED SINCE CHRISTS DAY  A RICH MAN TODAY WHO
GIVES ALL HE HAS TO THE POOR IS CRAZY  THERE IS NO DISCUSSION  SOCIETY
HAS SPOKEN 



CHAPTER XIII

THE GENERAL STRIKE


OF COURSE ERNEST WAS ELECTED TO CONGRESS IN THE GREAT SOCIALIST
LANDSLIDE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE FALL OF   ONE GREAT FACTOR THAT
HELPED TO SWELL THE SOCIALIST VOTE WAS THE DESTRUCTION OF HEARST 
THIS THE PLUTOCRACY FOUND AN EASY TASK  IT COST HEARST EIGHTEEN MILLION
DOLLARS A YEAR TO RUN HIS VARIOUS PAPERS  AND THIS SUM  AND MORE  HE GOT
BACK FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS IN PAYMENT FOR ADVERTISING  THE SOURCE OF HIS
FINANCIAL STRENGTH LAY WHOLLY IN THE MIDDLE CLASS  THE TRUSTS DID NOT
ADVERTISE  TO DESTROY HEARST  ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY WAS TO TAKE AWAY
FROM HIM HIS ADVERTISING 

      WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARSTA YOUNG CALIFORNIA MILLIONAIRE
     WHO BECAME THE MOST POWERFUL NEWSPAPER OWNER IN THE COUNTRY 
     HIS NEWSPAPERS WERE PUBLISHED IN ALL THE LARGE CITIES  AND
     THEY APPEALED TO THE PERISHING MIDDLE CLASS AND TO THE
     PROLETARIAT   SO LARGE WAS HIS FOLLOWING THAT HE MANAGED TO
     TAKE POSSESSION OF THE EMPTY SHELL OF THE OLD DEMOCRATIC
     PARTY   HE OCCUPIED AN ANOMALOUS POSITION  PREACHING AN
     EMASCULATED SOCIALISM COMBINED WITH A NONDESCRIPT SORT OF
     PETTY BOURGEOIS CAPITALISM   IT WAS OIL AND WATER  AND THERE
     WAS NO HOPE FOR HIM  THOUGH FOR A SHORT PERIOD HE WAS A
     SOURCE OF SERIOUS APPREHENSION TO THE PLUTOCRATS 

      THE COST OF ADVERTISING WAS AMAZING IN THOSE HELTER
     SKELTER TIMES   ONLY THE SMALL CAPITALISTS COMPETED  AND
     THEREFORE THEY DID THE ADVERTISING   THERE BEING NO
     COMPETITION WHERE THERE WAS A TRUST  THERE WAS NO NEED FOR
     THE TRUSTS TO ADVERTISE 

THE WHOLE MIDDLE CLASS HAD NOT YET BEEN EXTERMINATED  THE STURDY
SKELETON OF IT REMAINED BUT IT WAS WITHOUT POWER  THE SMALL
MANUFACTURERS AND SMALL BUSINESS MEN WHO STILL SURVIVED WERE AT THE
COMPLETE MERCY OF THE PLUTOCRACY  THEY HAD NO ECONOMIC NOR POLITICAL
SOULS OF THEIR OWN  WHEN THE FIAT OF THE PLUTOCRACY WENT FORTH  THEY
WITHDREW THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS FROM THE HEARST PAPERS 

HEARST MADE A GALLANT FIGHT  HE BROUGHT HIS PAPERS OUT AT A LOSS OF
A MILLION AND A HALF EACH MONTH  HE CONTINUED TO PUBLISH THE
ADVERTISEMENTS FOR WHICH HE NO LONGER RECEIVED PAY  AGAIN THE FIAT OF
THE PLUTOCRACY WENT FORTH  AND THE SMALL BUSINESS MEN AND MANUFACTURERS
SWAMPED HIM WITH A FLOOD OF NOTICES THAT HE MUST DISCONTINUE RUNNING
THEIR OLD ADVERTISEMENTS  HEARST PERSISTED  INJUNCTIONS WERE SERVED
ON HIM  STILL HE PERSISTED  HE RECEIVED SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT FOR
CONTEMPT OF COURT IN DISOBEYING THE INJUNCTIONS  WHILE HE WAS BANKRUPTED
BY COUNTLESS DAMAGE SUITS  HE HAD NO CHANCE  THE PLUTOCRACY HAD PASSED
SENTENCE ON HIM  THE COURTS WERE IN THE HANDS OF THE PLUTOCRACY TO
CARRY THE SENTENCE OUT  AND WITH HEARST CRASHED ALSO TO DESTRUCTION THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT HE HAD SO RECENTLY CAPTURED 

WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF HEARST AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY  THERE WERE ONLY
TWO PATHS FOR HIS FOLLOWING TO TAKE  ONE WAS INTO THE SOCIALIST PARTY
THE OTHER WAS INTO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  THEN IT WAS THAT WE SOCIALISTS
REAPED THE FRUIT OF HEARSTS PSEUDOSOCIALISTIC PREACHING FOR THE GREAT
MAJORITY OF HIS FOLLOWERS CAME OVER TO US 

THE EXPROPRIATION OF THE FARMERS THAT TOOK PLACE AT THIS TIME WOULD ALSO
HAVE SWELLED OUR VOTE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE BRIEF AND FUTILE RISE OF
THE GRANGE PARTY  ERNEST AND THE SOCIALIST LEADERS FOUGHT FIERCELY TO
CAPTURE THE FARMERS BUT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SOCIALIST PRESS
AND PUBLISHING HOUSES CONSTITUTED TOO GREAT A HANDICAP  WHILE THE
MOUTHTOMOUTH PROPAGANDA HAD NOT YET BEEN PERFECTED  SO IT WAS THAT
POLITICIANS LIKE MR  CALVIN  WHO WERE THEMSELVES FARMERS LONG SINCE
EXPROPRIATED  CAPTURED THE FARMERS AND THREW THEIR POLITICAL STRENGTH
AWAY IN A VAIN CAMPAIGN 

THE POOR FARMERS  ERNEST ONCE LAUGHED SAVAGELY THE TRUSTS HAVE THEM
BOTH COMING AND GOING 

AND THAT WAS REALLY THE SITUATION  THE SEVEN GREAT TRUSTS  WORKING
TOGETHER  HAD POOLED THEIR ENORMOUS SURPLUSES AND MADE A FARM TRUST 
THE RAILROADS  CONTROLLING RATES  AND THE BANKERS AND STOCK EXCHANGE
GAMESTERS  CONTROLLING PRICES  HAD LONG SINCE BLED THE FARMERS INTO
INDEBTEDNESS  THE BANKERS  AND ALL THE TRUSTS FOR THAT MATTER  HAD
LIKEWISE LONG SINCE LOANED COLOSSAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO THE FARMERS  THE
FARMERS WERE IN THE NET  ALL THAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS THE DRAWING IN
OF THE NET  THIS THE FARM TRUST PROCEEDED TO DO 

THE HARD TIMES OF  HAD ALREADY CAUSED A FRIGHTFUL SLUMP IN THE FARM
MARKETS  PRICES WERE NOW DELIBERATELY PRESSED DOWN TO BANKRUPTCY 
WHILE THE RAILROADS  WITH EXTORTIONATE RATES  BROKE THE BACK OF THE
FARMERCAMEL  THUS THE FARMERS WERE COMPELLED TO BORROW MORE AND MORE 
WHILE THEY WERE PREVENTED FROM PAYING BACK OLD LOANS  THEN ENSUED THE
GREAT FORECLOSING OF MORTGAGES AND ENFORCED COLLECTION OF NOTES  THE
FARMERS SIMPLY SURRENDERED THE LAND TO THE FARM TRUST  THERE WAS NOTHING
ELSE FOR THEM TO DO  AND HAVING SURRENDERED THE LAND  THE FARMERS NEXT
WENT TO WORK FOR THE FARM TRUST  BECOMING MANAGERS  SUPERINTENDENTS 
FOREMEN  AND COMMON LABORERS  THEY WORKED FOR WAGES  THEY BECAME
VILLEINS  IN SHORTSERFS BOUND TO THE SOIL BY A LIVING WAGE  THEY COULD
NOT LEAVE THEIR MASTERS  FOR THEIR MASTERS COMPOSED THE PLUTOCRACY 
THEY COULD NOT GO TO THE CITIES  FOR THERE  ALSO  THE PLUTOCRACY WAS
IN CONTROL  THEY HAD BUT ONE ALTERNATIVE TO LEAVE THE SOIL AND BECOME
VAGRANTS  IN BRIEF  TO STARVE  AND EVEN THERE THEY WERE FRUSTRATED  FOR
STRINGENT VAGRANCY LAWS WERE PASSED AND RIGIDLY ENFORCED 

OF COURSE  HERE AND THERE  FARMERS  AND EVEN WHOLE COMMUNITIES OF
FARMERS  ESCAPED EXPROPRIATION BY VIRTUE OF EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS  BUT
THEY WERE MERELY STRAYS AND DID NOT COUNT  AND THEY WERE GATHERED IN
ANYWAY DURING THE FOLLOWING YEAR 

      THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN YEOMANRY PROCEEDED FAR LESS
     RAPIDLY THAN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE AMERICAN FARMERS AND
     SMALL CAPITALISTS  THERE WAS MOMENTUM IN THE TWENTIETH
     CENTURY  WHILE THERE WAS PRACTICALLY NONE IN ANCIENT ROME 

     NUMBERS OF THE FARMERS  IMPELLED BY AN INSANE LUST FOR THE
     SOIL  AND WILLING TO SHOW WHAT BEASTS THEY COULD BECOME 
     TRIED TO ESCAPE EXPROPRIATION BY WITHDRAWING FROM ANY AND
     ALL MARKETDEALING   THEY SOLD NOTHING   THEY BOUGHT
     NOTHING   AMONG THEMSELVES A PRIMITIVE BARTER BEGAN TO
     SPRING UP   THEIR PRIVATION AND HARDSHIPS WERE TERRIBLE  BUT
     THEY PERSISTED   IT BECAME QUITE A MOVEMENT  IN FACT  THE
     MANNER IN WHICH THEY WERE BEATEN WAS UNIQUE AND LOGICAL AND
     SIMPLE   THE PLUTOCRACY  BY VIRTUE OF ITS POSSESSION OF THE
     GOVERNMENT  RAISED THEIR TAXES   IT WAS THE WEAK JOINT IN
     THEIR ARMOR   NEITHER BUYING NOR SELLING  THEY HAD NO MONEY 
     AND IN THE END THEIR LAND WAS SOLD TO PAY THE TAXES 

THUS IT WAS THAT IN THE FALL OF  THE SOCIALIST LEADERS  WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF ERNEST  DECIDED THAT THE END OF CAPITALISM HAD COME  WHAT
OF THE HARD TIMES AND THE CONSEQUENT VAST ARMY OF THE UNEMPLOYED WHAT
OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FARMERS AND THE MIDDLE CLASS AND WHAT OF THE
DECISIVE DEFEAT ADMINISTERED ALL ALONG THE LINE TO THE LABOR UNIONS THE
SOCIALISTS WERE REALLY JUSTIFIED IN BELIEVING THAT THE END OF CAPITALISM
HAD COME AND IN THEMSELVES THROWING DOWN THE GAUNTLET TO THE PLUTOCRACY 

ALAS  HOW WE UNDERESTIMATED THE STRENGTH OF THE ENEMY EVERYWHERE THE
SOCIALISTS PROCLAIMED THEIR COMING VICTORY AT THE BALLOTBOX  WHILE  IN
UNMISTAKABLE TERMS  THEY STATED THE SITUATION  THE PLUTOCRACY ACCEPTED
THE CHALLENGE  IT WAS THE PLUTOCRACY  WEIGHING AND BALANCING  THAT
DEFEATED US BY DIVIDING OUR STRENGTH  IT WAS THE PLUTOCRACY  THROUGH ITS
SECRET AGENTS  THAT RAISED THE CRY THAT SOCIALISM WAS SACRILEGIOUS
AND ATHEISTIC IT WAS THE PLUTOCRACY THAT WHIPPED THE CHURCHES  AND
ESPECIALLY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH  INTO LINE  AND ROBBED US OF A PORTION OF
THE LABOR VOTE  AND IT WAS THE PLUTOCRACY  THROUGH ITS SECRET AGENTS
OF COURSE  THAT ENCOURAGED THE GRANGE PARTY AND EVEN SPREAD IT TO THE
CITIES INTO THE RANKS OF THE DYING MIDDLE CLASS 

NEVERTHELESS THE SOCIALIST LANDSLIDE OCCURRED  BUT  INSTEAD OF A
SWEEPING VICTORY WITH CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND MAJORITIES IN ALL
LEGISLATIVE BODIES  WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE MINORITY  IT IS TRUE  WE
ELECTED FIFTY CONGRESSMEN BUT WHEN THEY TOOK THEIR SEATS IN THE SPRING
OF   THEY FOUND THEMSELVES WITHOUT POWER OF ANY SORT  YET THEY
WERE MORE FORTUNATE THAN THE GRANGERS  WHO CAPTURED A DOZEN STATE
GOVERNMENTS  AND WHO  IN THE SPRING  WERE NOT PERMITTED TO TAKE
POSSESSION OF THE CAPTURED OFFICES  THE INCUMBENTS REFUSED TO RETIRE 
AND THE COURTS WERE IN THE HANDS OF THE OLIGARCHY  BUT THIS IS TOO FAR
IN ADVANCE OF EVENTS  I HAVE YET TO TELL OF THE STIRRING TIMES OF THE
WINTER OF  

THE HARD TIMES AT HOME HAD CAUSED AN IMMENSE DECREASE IN CONSUMPTION 
LABOR  OUT OF WORK  HAD NO WAGES WITH WHICH TO BUY  THE RESULT WAS THAT
THE PLUTOCRACY FOUND A GREATER SURPLUS THAN EVER ON ITS HANDS  THIS
SURPLUS IT WAS COMPELLED TO DISPOSE OF ABROAD  AND  WHAT OF ITS COLOSSAL
PLANS  IT NEEDED MONEY  BECAUSE OF ITS STRENUOUS EFFORTS TO DISPOSE OF
THE SURPLUS IN THE WORLD MARKET  THE PLUTOCRACY CLASHED WITH GERMANY 
ECONOMIC CLASHES WERE USUALLY SUCCEEDED BY WARS  AND THIS PARTICULAR
CLASH WAS NO EXCEPTION  THE GREAT GERMAN WARLORD PREPARED  AND SO DID
THE UNITED STATES PREPARE 

THE WARCLOUD HOVERED DARK AND OMINOUS  THE STAGE WAS SET FOR A
WORLDCATASTROPHE  FOR IN ALL THE WORLD WERE HARD TIMES  LABOR TROUBLES 
PERISHING MIDDLE CLASSES  ARMIES OF UNEMPLOYED  CLASHES OF ECONOMIC
INTERESTS IN THE WORLDMARKET  AND MUTTERINGS AND RUMBLINGS OF THE
SOCIALIST REVOLUTION 

      FOR A LONG TIME THESE MUTTERINGS AND RUMBLINGS HAD BEEN
     HEARD  AS FAR BACK AS  A D   LORD AVEBURY  AN
     ENGLISHMAN  UTTERED THE FOLLOWING IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS 
     THE UNREST IN EUROPE  THE SPREAD OF SOCIALISM  AND THE
     OMINOUS RISE OF ANARCHISM  ARE WARNINGS TO THE GOVERNMENTS
     AND THE RULING CLASSES THAT THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING
     CLASSES IN EUROPE IS BECOMING INTOLERABLE  AND THAT IF A
     REVOLUTION IS TO BE AVOIDED SOME STEPS MUST BE TAKEN TO
     INCREASE WAGES  REDUCE THE HOURS OF LABOR  AND LOWER THE
     PRICES OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE   THE WALL STREET
     JOURNAL  A STOCK GAMESTERS PUBLICATION  IN COMMENTING UPON
     LORD AVEBURYS SPEECH  SAID  THESE WORDS WERE SPOKEN BY AN
     ARISTOCRAT AND A MEMBER OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE BODY IN ALL
     EUROPE   THAT GIVES THEM ALL THE MORE SIGNIFICANCE   THEY
     CONTAIN MORE VALUABLE POLITICAL ECONOMY THAN IS TO BE FOUND
     IN MOST OF THE BOOKS   THEY SOUND A NOTE OF WARNING  TAKE
     HEED  GENTLEMEN OF THE WAR AND NAVY DEPARTMENTS

     AT THE SAME TIME  SYDNEY BROOKS  WRITING IN AMERICA  IN
     HARPERS WEEKLY  SAID  YOU WILL NOT HEAR THE SOCIALISTS
     MENTIONED IN WASHINGTON   WHY SHOULD YOU  THE POLITICIANS
     ARE ALWAYS THE LAST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY TO SEE WHAT IS
     GOING ON UNDER THEIR NOSES  THEY WILL JEER AT ME WHEN I
     PROPHESY  AND PROPHESY WITH THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE  THAT AT
     THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THE SOCIALISTS WILL POLL OVER
     A MILLION VOTES 

THE OLIGARCHY WANTED THE WAR WITH GERMANY  AND IT WANTED THE WAR FOR A
DOZEN REASONS  IN THE JUGGLING OF EVENTS SUCH A WAR WOULD CAUSE  IN THE
RESHUFFLING OF THE INTERNATIONAL CARDS AND THE MAKING OF NEW TREATIES
AND ALLIANCES  THE OLIGARCHY HAD MUCH TO GAIN  AND  FURTHERMORE  THE WAR
WOULD CONSUME MANY NATIONAL SURPLUSES  REDUCE THE ARMIES OF UNEMPLOYED
THAT MENACED ALL COUNTRIES  AND GIVE THE OLIGARCHY A BREATHING SPACE
IN WHICH TO PERFECT ITS PLANS AND CARRY THEM OUT  SUCH A WAR WOULD
VIRTUALLY PUT THE OLIGARCHY IN POSSESSION OF THE WORLDMARKET  ALSO 
SUCH A WAR WOULD CREATE A LARGE STANDING ARMY THAT NEED NEVER BE
DISBANDED  WHILE IN THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE WOULD BE SUBSTITUTED
THE ISSUE  AMERICA VERSUS GERMANY  IN PLACE OF SOCIALISM VERSUS
OLIGARCHY 

AND TRULY THE WAR WOULD HAVE DONE ALL THESE THINGS HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR
THE SOCIALISTS  A SECRET MEETING OF THE WESTERN LEADERS WAS HELD IN OUR
FOUR TINY ROOMS IN PELL STREET  HERE WAS FIRST CONSIDERED THE STAND THE
SOCIALISTS WERE TO TAKE  IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE HAD PUT OUR FOOT
DOWN UPON WAR  BUT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAD DONE SO IN THE UNITED
STATES  AFTER OUR SECRET MEETING WE GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE NATIONAL
ORGANIZATION  AND SOON OUR CODE CABLES WERE PASSING BACK AND FORTH
ACROSS THE ATLANTIC BETWEEN US AND THE INTERNATIONAL BUREAU 

      IT WAS AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
     A D   THAT THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE SOCIALISTS
     FINALLY FORMULATED THEIR LONGMATURING POLICY ON WAR 
     EPITOMIZED THEIR DOCTRINE WAS  WHY SHOULD THE WORKINGMEN OF
     ONE COUNTRY FIGHT WITH THE WORKINGMEN OF ANOTHER COUNTRY FOR
     THE BENEFIT OF THEIR CAPITALIST MASTERS

     ON MAY    A D   WHEN WAR THREATENED BETWEEN AUSTRIA
     AND ITALY  THE SOCIALISTS OF ITALY  AUSTRIA  AND HUNGARY
     HELD A CONFERENCE AT TRIESTE  AND THREATENED A GENERAL
     STRIKE OF THE WORKINGMEN OF BOTH COUNTRIES IN CASE WAR WAS
     DECLARED   THIS WAS REPEATED THE FOLLOWING YEAR  WHEN THE
     MOROCCO AFFAIR THREATENED TO INVOLVE FRANCE  GERMANY  AND
     ENGLAND 

THE GERMAN SOCIALISTS WERE READY TO ACT WITH US  THERE WERE OVER FIVE
MILLION OF THEM  MANY OF THEM IN THE STANDING ARMY  AND  IN ADDITION 
THEY WERE ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THE LABOR UNIONS  IN BOTH COUNTRIES THE
SOCIALISTS CAME OUT IN BOLD DECLARATION AGAINST THE WAR AND THREATENED
THE GENERAL STRIKE  AND IN THE MEANTIME THEY MADE PREPARATION FOR THE
GENERAL STRIKE  FURTHERMORE  THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTIES IN ALL COUNTRIES
GAVE PUBLIC UTTERANCE TO THE SOCIALIST PRINCIPLE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE
THAT MUST BE PRESERVED AT ALL HAZARDS  EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF REVOLT AND
REVOLUTION AT HOME 

THE GENERAL STRIKE WAS THE ONE GREAT VICTORY WE AMERICAN SOCIALISTS
WON  ON THE TH OF DECEMBER THE AMERICAN MINISTER WAS WITHDRAWN FROM
THE GERMAN CAPITAL  THAT NIGHT A GERMAN FLEET MADE A DASH ON HONOLULU 
SINKING THREE AMERICAN CRUISERS AND A REVENUE CUTTER  AND BOMBARDING
THE CITY  NEXT DAY BOTH GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES DECLARED WAR 
AND WITHIN AN HOUR THE SOCIALISTS CALLED THE GENERAL STRIKE IN BOTH
COUNTRIES 

FOR THE FIRST TIME THE GERMAN WARLORD FACED THE MEN OF HIS EMPIRE
WHO MADE HIS EMPIRE GO  WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE  THE
NOVELTY OF THE SITUATION LAY IN THAT THEIR REVOLT WAS PASSIVE  THEY
DID NOT FIGHT  THEY DID NOTHING  AND BY DOING NOTHING THEY TIED THEIR
WARLORDS HANDS  HE WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR NOTHING BETTER THAN AN
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOSE HIS WARDOGS ON HIS REBELLIOUS PROLETARIAT  BUT
THIS WAS DENIED HIM  HE COULD NOT LOOSE HIS WARDOGS  NEITHER COULD
HE MOBILIZE HIS ARMY TO GO FORTH TO WAR  NOR COULD HE PUNISH HIS
RECALCITRANT SUBJECTS  NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE  NOT A TRAIN RAN 
NOT A TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGE WENT OVER THE WIRES  FOR THE TELEGRAPHERS AND
RAILROAD MEN HAD CEASED WORK ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE POPULATION 

AND AS IT WAS IN GERMANY  SO IT WAS IN THE UNITED STATES  AT LAST
ORGANIZED LABOR HAD LEARNED ITS LESSON  BEATEN DECISIVELY ON ITS OWN
CHOSEN FIELD  IT HAD ABANDONED THAT FIELD AND COME OVER TO THE POLITICAL
FIELD OF THE SOCIALISTS FOR THE GENERAL STRIKE WAS A POLITICAL STRIKE 
BESIDES  ORGANIZED LABOR HAD BEEN SO BADLY BEATEN THAT IT DID NOT CARE 
IT JOINED IN THE GENERAL STRIKE OUT OF SHEER DESPERATION  THE WORKERS
THREW DOWN THEIR TOOLS AND LEFT THEIR TASKS BY THE MILLIONS  ESPECIALLY
NOTABLE WERE THE MACHINISTS  THEIR HEADS WERE BLOODY  THEIR ORGANIZATION
HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DESTROYED  YET OUT THEY CAME  ALONG WITH THEIR
ALLIES IN THE METALWORKING TRADES 

EVEN THE COMMON LABORERS AND ALL UNORGANIZED LABOR CEASED WORK  THE
STRIKE HAD TIED EVERYTHING UP SO THAT NOBODY COULD WORK  BESIDES  THE
WOMEN PROVED TO BE THE STRONGEST PROMOTERS OF THE STRIKE  THEY SET THEIR
FACES AGAINST THE WAR  THEY DID NOT WANT THEIR MEN TO GO FORTH TO
DIE  THEN  ALSO  THE IDEA OF THE GENERAL STRIKE CAUGHT THE MOOD OF THE
PEOPLE  IT STRUCK THEIR SENSE OF HUMOR  THE IDEA WAS INFECTIOUS  THE
CHILDREN STRUCK IN ALL THE SCHOOLS  AND SUCH TEACHERS AS CAME  WENT HOME
AGAIN FROM DESERTED CLASS ROOMS  THE GENERAL STRIKE TOOK THE FORM OF
A GREAT NATIONAL PICNIC  AND THE IDEA OF THE SOLIDARITY OF LABOR  SO
EVIDENCED  APPEALED TO THE IMAGINATION OF ALL  AND  FINALLY  THERE WAS
NO DANGER TO BE INCURRED BY THE COLOSSAL FROLIC  WHEN EVERYBODY WAS
GUILTY  HOW WAS ANYBODY TO BE PUNISHED

THE UNITED STATES WAS PARALYZED  NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING  THERE
WERE NO NEWSPAPERS  NO LETTERS  NO DESPATCHES  EVERY COMMUNITY WAS AS
COMPLETELY ISOLATED AS THOUGH TEN THOUSAND MILES OF PRIMEVAL WILDERNESS
STRETCHED BETWEEN IT AND THE REST OF THE WORLD  FOR THAT MATTER  THE
WORLD HAD CEASED TO EXIST  AND FOR A WEEK THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS WAS
MAINTAINED 

IN SAN FRANCISCO WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING EVEN ACROSS THE BAY
IN OAKLAND OR BERKELEY  THE EFFECT ON ONES SENSIBILITIES WAS WEIRD 
DEPRESSING  IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME GREAT COSMIC THING LAY DEAD  THE
PULSE OF THE LAND HAD CEASED TO BEAT  OF A TRUTH THE NATION HAD DIED 
THERE WERE NO WAGONS RUMBLING ON THE STREETS  NO FACTORY WHISTLES  NO
HUM OF ELECTRICITY IN THE AIR  NO PASSING OF STREET CARS  NO CRIES
OF NEWSBOYSNOTHING BUT PERSONS WHO AT RARE INTERVALS WENT BY LIKE
FURTIVE GHOSTS  THEMSELVES OPPRESSED AND MADE UNREAL BY THE SILENCE 

AND DURING THAT WEEK OF SILENCE THE OLIGARCHY WAS TAUGHT ITS LESSON  AND
WELL IT LEARNED THE LESSON  THE GENERAL STRIKE WAS A WARNING  IT SHOULD
NEVER OCCUR AGAIN  THE OLIGARCHY WOULD SEE TO THAT 

AT THE END OF THE WEEK  AS HAD BEEN PREARRANGED  THE TELEGRAPHERS OF
GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES RETURNED TO THEIR POSTS  THROUGH THEM THE
SOCIALIST LEADERS OF BOTH COUNTRIES PRESENTED THEIR ULTIMATUM TO THE
RULERS  THE WAR SHOULD BE CALLED OFF  OR THE GENERAL STRIKE WOULD
CONTINUE  IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING  THE WAR WAS
DECLARED OFF  AND THE POPULATIONS OF BOTH COUNTRIES RETURNED TO THEIR
TASKS 

IT WAS THIS RENEWAL OF PEACE THAT BROUGHT ABOUT THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN
GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES  IN REALITY  THIS WAS AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN
THE EMPEROR AND THE OLIGARCHY  FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING THEIR COMMON
FOE  THE REVOLUTIONARY PROLETARIAT OF BOTH COUNTRIES  AND IT WAS THIS
ALLIANCE THAT THE OLIGARCHY AFTERWARD SO TREACHEROUSLY BROKE WHEN THE
GERMAN SOCIALISTS ROSE AND DROVE THE WARLORD FROM HIS THRONE  IT WAS
THE VERY THING THE OLIGARCHY HAD PLAYED FORTHE DESTRUCTION OF ITS
GREAT RIVAL IN THE WORLDMARKET  WITH THE GERMAN EMPEROR OUT OF THE WAY 
GERMANY WOULD HAVE NO SURPLUS TO SELL ABROAD  BY THE VERY NATURE OF
THE SOCIALIST STATE  THE GERMAN POPULATION WOULD CONSUME ALL THAT IT
PRODUCED  OF COURSE  IT WOULD TRADE ABROAD CERTAIN THINGS IT PRODUCED
FOR THINGS IT DID NOT PRODUCE BUT THIS WOULD BE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM AN
UNCONSUMABLE SURPLUS 

ILL WAGER THE OLIGARCHY FINDS JUSTIFICATION  ERNEST SAID  WHEN ITS
TREACHERY TO THE GERMAN EMPEROR BECAME KNOWN  AS USUAL  THE OLIGARCHY
WILL BELIEVE IT HAS DONE RIGHT 

AND SURE ENOUGH  THE OLIGARCHYS PUBLIC DEFENCE FOR THE ACT WAS THAT IT
HAD DONE IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHOSE INTERESTS IT WAS
LOOKING OUT FOR  IT HAD FLUNG ITS HATED RIVAL OUT OF THE WORLDMARKET
AND ENABLED US TO DISPOSE OF OUR SURPLUS IN THAT MARKET 

AND THE HOWLING FOLLY OF IT IS THAT WE ARE SO HELPLESS THAT SUCH IDIOTS
REALLY ARE MANAGING OUR INTERESTS  WAS ERNESTS COMMENT  THEY HAVE
ENABLED US TO SELL MORE ABROAD  WHICH MEANS THAT WELL BE COMPELLED TO
CONSUME LESS AT HOME 



CHAPTER XIV

THE BEGINNING OF THE END


AS EARLY AS JANUARY    ERNEST SAW THE TRUE TREND OF AFFAIRS  BUT
HE COULD NOT GET HIS BROTHER LEADERS TO SEE THE VISION OF THE IRON
HEEL THAT HAD ARISEN IN HIS BRAIN  THEY WERE TOO CONFIDENT  EVENTS WERE
RUSHING TOO RAPIDLY TO CULMINATION  A CRISIS HAD COME IN WORLD
AFFAIRS  THE AMERICAN OLIGARCHY WAS PRACTICALLY IN POSSESSION OF THE
WORLDMARKET  AND SCORES OF COUNTRIES WERE FLUNG OUT OF THAT MARKET WITH
UNCONSUMABLE AND UNSALABLE SURPLUSES ON THEIR HANDS  FOR SUCH COUNTRIES
NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION  THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR
METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES  THE CAPITALISTIC SYSTEM  SO FAR AS THEY
WERE CONCERNED  HAD HOPELESSLY BROKEN DOWN 

THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION 
IT WAS A TIME OF CONFUSION AND VIOLENCE  EVERYWHERE INSTITUTIONS AND
GOVERNMENTS WERE CRASHING  EVERYWHERE  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO OR
THREE COUNTRIES  THE ERSTWHILE CAPITALIST MASTERS FOUGHT BITTERLY FOR
THEIR POSSESSIONS  BUT THE GOVERNMENTS WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM BY THE
MILITANT PROLETARIAT  AT LAST WAS BEING REALIZED KARL MARXS CLASSIC 
THE KNELL OF PRIVATE CAPITALIST PROPERTY SOUNDS  THE EXPROPRIATORS
ARE EXPROPRIATED  AND AS FAST AS CAPITALISTIC GOVERNMENTS CRASHED 
COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTHS AROSE IN THEIR PLACE 

WHY DOES THE UNITED STATES LAG BEHIND GET BUSY  YOU AMERICAN
REVOLUTIONISTS WHATS THE MATTER WITH AMERICAWERE THE MESSAGES
SENT TO US BY OUR SUCCESSFUL COMRADES IN OTHER LANDS  BUT WE COULD NOT
KEEP UP  THE OLIGARCHY STOOD IN THE WAY  ITS BULK  LIKE THAT OF SOME
HUGE MONSTER  BLOCKED OUR PATH 

WAIT TILL WE TAKE OFFICE IN THE SPRING  WE ANSWERED  THEN YOULL
SEE 

BEHIND THIS LAY OUR SECRET  WE HAD WON OVER THE GRANGERS  AND IN THE
SPRING A DOZEN STATES WOULD PASS INTO THEIR HANDS BY VIRTUE OF THE
ELECTIONS OF THE PRECEDING FALL  AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN
COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES  AFTER THAT  THE REST WOULD BE EASY 

BUT WHAT IF THE GRANGERS FAIL TO GET POSSESSION ERNEST DEMANDED  AND
HIS COMRADES CALLED HIM A CALAMITY HOWLER 

BUT THIS FAILURE TO GET POSSESSION WAS NOT THE CHIEF DANGER THAT ERNEST
HAD IN MIND  WHAT HE FORESAW WAS THE DEFECTION OF THE GREAT LABOR UNIONS
AND THE RISE OF THE CASTES 

GHENT HAS TAUGHT THE OLIGARCHS HOW TO DO IT  ERNEST SAID  ILL WAGER
THEYVE MADE A TEXTBOOK OUT OF HIS BENEVOLENT FEUDALISM 

      OUR BENEVOLENT FEUDALISM  A BOOK PUBLISHED IN  A D  
     BY W  J  GHENT   IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN INSISTED THAT GHENT PUT
     THE IDEA OF THE OLIGARCHY INTO THE MINDS OF THE GREAT
     CAPITALISTS   THIS BELIEF PERSISTS THROUGHOUT THE LITERATURE
     OF THE THREE CENTURIES OF THE IRON HEEL  AND EVEN IN THE
     LITERATURE OF THE FIRST CENTURY OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN 
     TODAY WE KNOW BETTER  BUT OUR KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT OVERCOME
     THE FACT THAT GHENT REMAINS THE MOST ABUSED INNOCENT MAN IN
     ALL HISTORY 

NEVER SHALL I FORGET THE NIGHT WHEN  AFTER A HOT DISCUSSION WITH HALF A
DOZEN LABOR LEADERS  ERNEST TURNED TO ME AND SAID QUIETLY  THAT SETTLES
IT  THE IRON HEEL HAS WON  THE END IS IN SIGHT 

THIS LITTLE CONFERENCE IN OUR HOME WAS UNOFFICIAL BUT ERNEST  LIKE THE
REST OF HIS COMRADES  WAS WORKING FOR ASSURANCES FROM THE LABOR LEADERS
THAT THEY WOULD CALL OUT THEIR MEN IN THE NEXT GENERAL STRIKE  OCONNOR 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS  HAD BEEN FOREMOST OF THE
SIX LEADERS PRESENT IN REFUSING TO GIVE SUCH ASSURANCE 

YOU HAVE SEEN THAT YOU WERE BEATEN SOUNDLY AT YOUR OLD TACTICS OF
STRIKE AND BOYCOTT  ERNEST URGED 

OCONNOR AND THE OTHERS NODDED THEIR HEADS 

AND YOU SAW WHAT A GENERAL STRIKE WOULD DO  ERNEST WENT ON  WE
STOPPED THE WAR WITH GERMANY  NEVER WAS THERE SO FINE A DISPLAY OF THE
SOLIDARITY AND THE POWER OF LABOR  LABOR CAN AND WILL RULE THE WORLD 
IF YOU CONTINUE TO STAND WITH US  WELL PUT AN END TO THE REIGN OF
CAPITALISM  IT IS YOUR ONLY HOPE  AND WHAT IS MORE  YOU KNOW IT  THERE
IS NO OTHER WAY OUT  NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO UNDER YOUR OLD TACTICS  YOU
ARE DOOMED TO DEFEAT  IF FOR NO OTHER REASON BECAUSE THE MASTERS CONTROL
THE COURTS 

      AS A SAMPLE OF THE DECISIONS OF THE COURTS ADVERSE TO
     LABOR  THE FOLLOWING INSTANCES ARE GIVEN   IN THE COAL
     MINING REGIONS THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN WAS NOTORIOUS   IN
      A D   LABOR SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A LAW PASSED IN
     PENNSYLVANIA PROVIDING THAT PROOF OF THE AGE OF THE CHILD
     AND OF CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS MUST ACCOMPANY THE
     OATH OF THE PARENT   THIS WAS PROMPTLY DECLARED
     UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY THE LUZERNE COUNTY COURT  ON THE GROUND
     THAT IT VIOLATED THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT IN THAT IT
     DISCRIMINATED BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS OF THE SAME CLASSNAMELY 
     CHILDREN ABOVE FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND CHILDREN BELOW 
     THE STATE COURT SUSTAINED THE DECISION   THE NEW YORK COURT
     OF SPECIAL SESSIONS  IN  A D   DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL
     THE LAW PROHIBITING MINORS AND WOMEN FROM WORKING IN
     FACTORIES AFTER NINE OCLOCK AT NIGHT  THE GROUND TAKEN
     BEING THAT SUCH A LAW WAS CLASS LEGISLATION   AGAIN  THE
     BAKERS OF THAT TIME WERE TERRIBLY OVERWORKED   THE NEW YORK
     LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW RESTRICTING WORK IN BAKERIES TO TEN
     HOURS A DAY   IN  A D   THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED
     STATES DECLARED THIS LAW TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL   IN PART
     THE DECISION READ  THERE IS NO REASONABLE GROUND FOR
     INTERFERING WITH THE LIBERTY OF PERSONS OR THE RIGHT OF FREE
     CONTRACT BY DETERMINING THE HOURS OF LABOR IN THE OCCUPATION
     OF A BAKER 

YOU RUN AHEAD TOO FAST  OCONNOR ANSWERED  YOU DONT KNOW ALL THE
WAYS OUT  THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OUT  WE KNOW WHAT WERE ABOUT  WERE SICK
OF STRIKES  THEYVE GOT US BEATEN THAT WAY TO A FRAZZLE  BUT I DONT
THINK WELL EVER NEED TO CALL OUR MEN OUT AGAIN 

WHAT IS YOUR WAY OUT ERNEST DEMANDED BLUNTLY 

OCONNOR LAUGHED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD  I CAN TELL YOU THIS MUCH  WEVE
NOT BEEN ASLEEP  AND WERE NOT DREAMING NOW 

THERES NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF  OR ASHAMED OF  I HOPE  ERNEST
CHALLENGED 

I GUESS WE KNOW OUR BUSINESS BEST  WAS THE RETORT 

ITS A DARK BUSINESS  FROM THE WAY YOU HIDE IT  ERNEST SAID WITH
GROWING ANGER 

WEVE PAID FOR OUR EXPERIENCE IN SWEAT AND BLOOD  AND WEVE EARNED ALL
THATS COMING TO US  WAS THE REPLY  CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME 

IF YOURE AFRAID TO TELL ME YOUR WAY OUT  ILL TELL IT TO YOU 
ERNESTS BLOOD WAS UP  YOURE GOING IN FOR GRABSHARING  YOUVE MADE
TERMS WITH THE ENEMY  THATS WHAT YOUVE DONE  YOUVE SOLD OUT THE CAUSE
OF LABOR  OF ALL LABOR  YOU ARE LEAVING THE BATTLEFIELD LIKE COWARDS 

IM NOT SAYING ANYTHING  OCONNOR ANSWERED SULLENLY  ONLY I GUESS WE
KNOW WHATS BEST FOR US A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN YOU DO 

AND YOU DONT CARE A CENT FOR WHAT IS BEST FOR THE REST OF LABOR  YOU
KICK IT INTO THE DITCH 

IM NOT SAYING ANYTHING  OCONNOR REPLIED  EXCEPT THAT IM PRESIDENT
OF THE MACHINISTS ASSOCIATION  AND ITS MY BUSINESS TO CONSIDER THE
INTERESTS OF THE MEN I REPRESENT  THATS ALL 

AND THEN  WHEN THE LABOR LEADERS HAD LEFT  ERNEST  WITH THE CALMNESS OF
DEFEAT  OUTLINED TO ME THE COURSE OF EVENTS TO COME 

THE SOCIALISTS USED TO FORETELL WITH JOY  HE SAID  THE COMING OF THE
DAY WHEN ORGANIZED LABOR  DEFEATED ON THE INDUSTRIAL FIELD  WOULD COME
OVER ON TO THE POLITICAL FIELD  WELL  THE IRON HEEL HAS DEFEATED
THE LABOR UNIONS ON THE INDUSTRIAL FIELD AND DRIVEN THEM OVER TO THE
POLITICAL FIELD AND INSTEAD OF THIS BEING JOYFUL FOR US  IT WILL BE
A SOURCE OF GRIEF  THE IRON HEEL LEARNED ITS LESSON  WE SHOWED IT OUR
POWER IN THE GENERAL STRIKE  IT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO PREVENT ANOTHER
GENERAL STRIKE 

BUT HOW I ASKED 

SIMPLY BY SUBSIDIZING THE GREAT UNIONS  THEY WONT JOIN IN THE NEXT
GENERAL STRIKE  THEREFORE IT WONT BE A GENERAL STRIKE 

BUT THE IRON HEEL CANT MAINTAIN SO COSTLY A PROGRAMME FOREVER  I
OBJECTED 

OH  IT HASNT SUBSIDIZED ALL OF THE UNIONS  THATS NOT NECESSARY  HERE
IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN  WAGES ARE GOING TO BE ADVANCED AND HOURS
SHORTENED IN THE RAILROAD UNIONS  THE IRON AND STEEL WORKERS UNIONS 
AND THE ENGINEER AND MACHINIST UNIONS  IN THESE UNIONS MORE FAVORABLE
CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO PREVAIL  MEMBERSHIP IN THESE UNIONS WILL
BECOME LIKE SEATS IN PARADISE 

STILL I DONT SEE  I OBJECTED  WHAT IS TO BECOME OF THE OTHER UNIONS
THERE ARE FAR MORE UNIONS OUTSIDE OF THIS COMBINATION THAN IN IT 

THE OTHER UNIONS WILL BE GROUND OUT OF EXISTENCEALL OF THEM  FOR 
DONT YOU SEE  THE RAILWAY MEN  MACHINISTS AND ENGINEERS  IRON AND
STEEL WORKERS  DO ALL OF THE VITALLY ESSENTIAL WORK IN OUR MACHINE
CIVILIZATION  ASSURED OF THEIR FAITHFULNESS  THE IRON HEEL CAN SNAP
ITS FINGERS AT ALL THE REST OF LABOR  IRON  STEEL  COAL  MACHINERY  AND
TRANSPORTATION CONSTITUTE THE BACKBONE OF THE WHOLE INDUSTRIAL FABRIC 

BUT COAL I QUERIED  THERE ARE NEARLY A MILLION COAL MINERS 

THEY ARE PRACTICALLY UNSKILLED LABOR  THEY WILL NOT COUNT  THEIR WAGES
WILL GO DOWN AND THEIR HOURS WILL INCREASE  THEY WILL BE SLAVES LIKE ALL
THE REST OF US  AND THEY WILL BECOME ABOUT THE MOST BESTIAL OF ALL OF
US  THEY WILL BE COMPELLED TO WORK  JUST AS THE FARMERS ARE COMPELLED
TO WORK NOW FOR THE MASTERS WHO ROBBED THEM OF THEIR LAND  AND THE SAME
WITH ALL THE OTHER UNIONS OUTSIDE THE COMBINATION  WATCH THEM WOBBLE AND
GO TO PIECES  AND THEIR MEMBERS BECOME SLAVES DRIVEN TO TOIL BY EMPTY
STOMACHS AND THE LAW OF THE LAND 

DO YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO FARLEY AND HIS STRIKEBREAKERS ILL
TELL YOU  STRIKEBREAKING AS AN OCCUPATION WILL CEASE  THERE WONT BE
ANY MORE STRIKES  IN PLACE OF STRIKES WILL BE SLAVE REVOLTS  FARLEY AND
HIS GANG WILL BE PROMOTED TO SLAVEDRIVING  OH  IT WONT BE CALLED
THAT IT WILL BE CALLED ENFORCING THE LAW OF THE LAND THAT COMPELS THE
LABORERS TO WORK  IT SIMPLY PROLONGS THE FIGHT  THIS TREACHERY OF THE
BIG UNIONS  HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS NOW WHERE AND WHEN THE REVOLUTION WILL
TRIUMPH 

      JAMES FARLEYA NOTORIOUS STRIKEBREAKER OF THE PERIOD   A
     MAN MORE COURAGEOUS THAN ETHICAL  AND OF UNDENIABLE ABILITY 
     HE ROSE HIGH UNDER THE RULE OF THE IRON HEEL AND FINALLY WAS
     TRANSLATED INTO THE OLIGARCH CLASS   HE WAS ASSASSINATED IN
      BY SARAH JENKINS  WHOSE HUSBAND  THIRTY YEARS BEFORE 
     HAD BEEN KILLED BY FARLEYS STRIKEBREAKERS 

BUT WITH SUCH A POWERFUL COMBINATION AS THE OLIGARCHY AND THE BIG
UNIONS  IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE REVOLUTION WILL EVER
TRIUMPH I QUERIED  MAY NOT THE COMBINATION ENDURE FOREVER

HE SHOOK HIS HEAD  ONE OF OUR GENERALIZATIONS IS THAT EVERY SYSTEM
FOUNDED UPON CLASS AND CASTE CONTAINS WITHIN ITSELF THE GERMS OF ITS OWN
DECAY  WHEN A SYSTEM IS FOUNDED UPON CLASS  HOW CAN CASTE BE PREVENTED
THE IRON HEEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT IT  AND IN THE END CASTE WILL
DESTROY THE IRON HEEL  THE OLIGARCHS HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED CASTE AMONG
THEMSELVES BUT WAIT UNTIL THE FAVORED UNIONS DEVELOP CASTE  THE IRON
HEEL WILL USE ALL ITS POWER TO PREVENT IT  BUT IT WILL FAIL 

IN THE FAVORED UNIONS ARE THE FLOWER OF THE AMERICAN WORKINGMEN  THEY
ARE STRONG  EFFICIENT MEN  THEY HAVE BECOME MEMBERS OF THOSE UNIONS
THROUGH COMPETITION FOR PLACE  EVERY FIT WORKMAN IN THE UNITED STATES
WILL BE POSSESSED BY THE AMBITION TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE FAVORED
UNIONS  THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT
COMPETITION  THUS WILL THE STRONG MEN  WHO MIGHT ELSE BE REVOLUTIONISTS 
BE WON AWAY AND THEIR STRENGTH USED TO BOLSTER THE OLIGARCHY 

ON THE OTHER HAND  THE LABOR CASTES  THE MEMBERS OF THE FAVORED UNIONS 
WILL STRIVE TO MAKE THEIR ORGANIZATIONS INTO CLOSE CORPORATIONS 
AND THEY WILL SUCCEED  MEMBERSHIP IN THE LABOR CASTES WILL BECOME
HEREDITARY  SONS WILL SUCCEED FATHERS  AND THERE WILL BE NO INFLOW OF
NEW STRENGTH FROM THAT ETERNAL RESERVOIR OF STRENGTH  THE COMMON PEOPLE 
THIS WILL MEAN DETERIORATION OF THE LABOR CASTES  AND IN THE END THEY
WILL BECOME WEAKER AND WEAKER  AT THE SAME TIME  AS AN INSTITUTION  THEY
WILL BECOME TEMPORARILY ALLPOWERFUL  THEY WILL BE LIKE THE GUARDS OF
THE PALACE IN OLD ROME  AND THERE WILL BE PALACE REVOLUTIONS WHEREBY
THE LABOR CASTES WILL SEIZE THE REINS OF POWER  AND THERE WILL BE
COUNTERPALACE REVOLUTIONS OF THE OLIGARCHS  AND SOMETIMES THE ONE  AND
SOMETIMES THE OTHER  WILL BE IN POWER  AND THROUGH IT ALL THE INEVITABLE
CASTEWEAKENING WILL GO ON  SO THAT IN THE END THE COMMON PEOPLE WILL
COME INTO THEIR OWN 

THIS FORESHADOWING OF A SLOW SOCIAL EVOLUTION WAS MADE WHEN ERNEST WAS
FIRST DEPRESSED BY THE DEFECTION OF THE GREAT UNIONS  I NEVER AGREED
WITH HIM IN IT  AND I DISAGREE NOW  AS I WRITE THESE LINES  MORE
HEARTILY THAN EVER FOR EVEN NOW  THOUGH ERNEST IS GONE  WE ARE ON THE
VERGE OF THE REVOLT THAT WILL SWEEP ALL OLIGARCHIES AWAY  YET I HAVE
HERE GIVEN ERNESTS PROPHECY BECAUSE IT WAS HIS PROPHECY  IN SPITE OF
HIS BELIEF IN IT  HE WORKED LIKE A GIANT AGAINST IT  AND HE  MORE THAN
ANY MAN  HAS MADE POSSIBLE THE REVOLT THAT EVEN NOW WAITS THE SIGNAL TO
BURST FORTH 

      EVERHARDS SOCIAL FORESIGHT WAS REMARKABLE   AS CLEARLY AS
     IN THE LIGHT OF PAST EVENTS  HE SAW THE DEFECTION OF THE
     FAVORED UNIONS  THE RISE AND THE SLOW DECAY OF THE LABOR
     CASTES  AND THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE DECAYING OLIGARCHS AND
     LABOR CASTES FOR CONTROL OF THE GREAT GOVERNMENTAL MACHINE 

BUT IF THE OLIGARCHY PERSISTS  I ASKED HIM THAT EVENING  WHAT WILL
BECOME OF THE GREAT SURPLUSES THAT WILL FALL TO ITS SHARE EVERY YEAR

THE SURPLUSES WILL HAVE TO BE EXPENDED SOMEHOW  HE ANSWERED AND
TRUST THE OLIGARCHS TO FIND A WAY  MAGNIFICENT ROADS WILL BE BUILT 
THERE WILL BE GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS IN SCIENCE  AND ESPECIALLY IN ART  WHEN
THE OLIGARCHS HAVE COMPLETELY MASTERED THE PEOPLE  THEY WILL HAVE TIME
TO SPARE FOR OTHER THINGS  THEY WILL BECOME WORSHIPPERS OF BEAUTY 
THEY WILL BECOME ARTLOVERS  AND UNDER THEIR DIRECTION AND GENEROUSLY
REWARDED  WILL TOIL THE ARTISTS  THE RESULT WILL BE GREAT ART FOR NO
LONGER  AS UP TO YESTERDAY  WILL THE ARTISTS PANDER TO THE BOURGEOIS
TASTE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS  IT WILL BE GREAT ART  I TELL YOU  AND WONDER
CITIES WILL ARISE THAT WILL MAKE TAWDRY AND CHEAP THE CITIES OF OLD
TIME  AND IN THESE CITIES WILL THE OLIGARCHS DWELL AND WORSHIP BEAUTY 

      WE CANNOT BUT MARVEL AT EVERHARDS FORESIGHT   BEFORE EVER
     THE THOUGHT OF WONDER CITIES LIKE ARDIS AND ASGARD ENTERED
     THE MINDS OF THE OLIGARCHS  EVERHARD SAW THOSE CITIES AND
     THE INEVITABLE NECESSITY FOR THEIR CREATION 

THUS WILL THE SURPLUS BE CONSTANTLY EXPENDED WHILE LABOR DOES THE WORK 
THE BUILDING OF THESE GREAT WORKS AND CITIES WILL GIVE A STARVATION
RATION TO MILLIONS OF COMMON LABORERS  FOR THE ENORMOUS BULK OF THE
SURPLUS WILL COMPEL AN EQUALLY ENORMOUS EXPENDITURE  AND THE OLIGARCHS
WILL BUILD FOR A THOUSAND YEARSAY  FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS  THEY WILL
BUILD AS THE EGYPTIANS AND THE BABYLONIANS NEVER DREAMED OF BUILDING
AND WHEN THE OLIGARCHS HAVE PASSED AWAY  THEIR GREAT ROADS AND THEIR
WONDER CITIES WILL REMAIN FOR THE BROTHERHOOD OF LABOR TO TREAD UPON AND
DWELL WITHIN 

      AND SINCE THAT DAY OF PROPHECY  HAVE PASSED AWAY THE THREE
     CENTURIES OF THE IRON HEEL AND THE FOUR CENTURIES OF THE
     BROTHERHOOD OF MAN  AND TODAY WE TREAD THE ROADS AND DWELL
     IN THE CITIES THAT THE OLIGARCHS BUILT   IT IS TRUE  WE ARE
     EVEN NOW BUILDING STILL MORE WONDERFUL WONDER CITIES  BUT
     THE WONDER CITIES OF THE OLIGARCHS ENDURE  AND I WRITE THESE
     LINES IN ARDIS  ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL OF THEM ALL 

THESE THINGS THE OLIGARCHS WILL DO BECAUSE THEY CANNOT HELP DOING THEM 
THESE GREAT WORKS WILL BE THE FORM THEIR EXPENDITURE OF THE SURPLUS WILL
TAKE  AND IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE RULING CLASSES OF EGYPT OF LONG AGO
EXPENDED THE SURPLUS THEY ROBBED FROM THE PEOPLE BY THE BUILDING OF
TEMPLES AND PYRAMIDS  UNDER THE OLIGARCHS WILL FLOURISH  NOT A PRIEST
CLASS  BUT AN ARTIST CLASS  AND IN PLACE OF THE MERCHANT CLASS OF
BOURGEOISIE WILL BE THE LABOR CASTES  AND BENEATH WILL BE THE ABYSS 
WHEREIN WILL FESTER AND STARVE AND ROT  AND EVER RENEW ITSELF  THE
COMMON PEOPLE  THE GREAT BULK OF THE POPULATION  AND IN THE END  WHO
KNOWS IN WHAT DAY  THE COMMON PEOPLE WILL RISE UP OUT OF THE ABYSS THE
LABOR CASTES AND THE OLIGARCHY WILL CRUMBLE AWAY AND THEN  AT LAST 
AFTER THE TRAVAIL OF THE CENTURIES  WILL IT BE THE DAY OF THE COMMON
MAN  I HAD THOUGHT TO SEE THAT DAY BUT NOW I KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER
SEE IT 

HE PAUSED AND LOOKED AT ME  AND ADDED 

SOCIAL EVOLUTION IS EXASPERATINGLY SLOW  ISNT IT  SWEETHEART

MY ARMS WERE ABOUT HIM  AND HIS HEAD WAS ON MY BREAST 

SING ME TO SLEEP  HE MURMURED WHIMSICALLY  I HAVE HAD A VISIONING 
AND I WISH TO FORGET 



CHAPTER XV

LAST DAYS


IT WAS NEAR THE END OF JANUARY    THAT THE CHANGED ATTITUDE OF THE
OLIGARCHY TOWARD THE FAVORED UNIONS WAS MADE PUBLIC  THE NEWSPAPERS
PUBLISHED INFORMATION OF AN UNPRECEDENTED RISE IN WAGES AND SHORTENING
OF HOURS FOR THE RAILROAD EMPLOYEES  THE IRON AND STEEL WORKERS  AND
THE ENGINEERS AND MACHINISTS  BUT THE WHOLE TRUTH WAS NOT TOLD  THE
OLIGARCHS DID NOT DARE PERMIT THE TELLING OF THE WHOLE TRUTH  IN
REALITY  THE WAGES HAD BEEN RAISED MUCH HIGHER  AND THE PRIVILEGES WERE
CORRESPONDINGLY GREATER  ALL THIS WAS SECRET  BUT SECRETS WILL OUT 
MEMBERS OF THE FAVORED UNIONS TOLD THEIR WIVES  AND THE WIVES GOSSIPED 
AND SOON ALL THE LABOR WORLD KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED 

IT WAS MERELY THE LOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
HAD BEEN KNOWN AS GRABSHARING  IN THE INDUSTRIAL WARFARE OF THAT TIME 
PROFITSHARING HAD BEEN TRIED  THAT IS  THE CAPITALISTS HAD STRIVEN TO
PLACATE THE WORKERS BY INTERESTING THEM FINANCIALLY IN THEIR WORK 
BUT PROFITSHARING  AS A SYSTEM  WAS RIDICULOUS AND IMPOSSIBLE 
PROFITSHARING COULD BE SUCCESSFUL ONLY IN ISOLATED CASES IN THE MIDST
OF A SYSTEM OF INDUSTRIAL STRIFE FOR IF ALL LABOR AND ALL CAPITAL
SHARED PROFITS  THE SAME CONDITIONS WOULD OBTAIN AS DID OBTAIN WHEN
THERE WAS NO PROFITSHARING 

SO  OUT OF THE UNPRACTICAL IDEA OF PROFITSHARING  AROSE THE PRACTICAL
IDEA OF GRABSHARING  GIVE US MORE PAY AND CHARGE IT TO THE PUBLIC 
WAS THE SLOGAN OF THE STRONG UNIONS  AND HERE AND THERE THIS SELFISH
POLICY WORKED SUCCESSFULLY  IN CHARGING IT TO THE PUBLIC  IT WAS CHARGED
TO THE GREAT MASS OF UNORGANIZED LABOR AND OF WEAKLY ORGANIZED LABOR 
THESE WORKERS ACTUALLY PAID THE INCREASED WAGES OF THEIR STRONGER
BROTHERS WHO WERE MEMBERS OF UNIONS THAT WERE LABOR MONOPOLIES  THIS
IDEA  AS I SAY  WAS MERELY CARRIED TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION  ON A LARGE
SCALE  BY THE COMBINATION OF THE OLIGARCHS AND THE FAVORED UNIONS 

      ALL THE RAILROAD UNIONS ENTERED INTO THIS COMBINATION WITH
     THE OLIGARCHS  AND IT IS OF INTEREST TO NOTE THAT THE FIRST
     DEFINITE APPLICATION OF THE POLICY OF PROFITGRABBING WAS
     MADE BY A RAILROAD UNION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY A D  
     NAMELY  THE BROTHERHOOD OF LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS   P  M 
     ARTHUR WAS FOR TWENTY YEARS GRAND CHIEF OF THE BROTHERHOOD 
     AFTER THE STRIKE ON THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD IN   HE
     BROACHED A SCHEME TO HAVE THE LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS MAKE
     TERMS WITH THE RAILROADS AND TO GO IT ALONE SO FAR AS THE
     REST OF THE LABOR UNIONS WERE CONCERNED   THIS SCHEME WAS
     EMINENTLY SUCCESSFUL   IT WAS AS SUCCESSFUL AS IT WAS
     SELFISH  AND OUT OF IT WAS COINED THE WORD ARTHURIZATION 
     TO DENOTE GRABSHARING ON THE PART OF LABOR UNIONS   THIS
     WORD ARTHURIZATION HAS LONG PUZZLED THE ETYMOLOGISTS  BUT
     ITS DERIVATION  I HOPE  IS NOW MADE CLEAR 

AS SOON AS THE SECRET OF THE DEFECTION OF THE FAVORED UNIONS LEAKED
OUT  THERE WERE RUMBLINGS AND MUTTERINGS IN THE LABOR WORLD  NEXT  THE
FAVORED UNIONS WITHDREW FROM THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND BROKE
OFF ALL AFFILIATIONS  THEN CAME TROUBLE AND VIOLENCE  THE MEMBERS OF THE
FAVORED UNIONS WERE BRANDED AS TRAITORS  AND IN SALOONS AND BROTHELS  ON
THE STREETS AND AT WORK  AND  IN FACT  EVERYWHERE  THEY WERE ASSAULTED
BY THE COMRADES THEY HAD SO TREACHEROUSLY DESERTED 

COUNTLESS HEADS WERE BROKEN  AND THERE WERE MANY KILLED  NO MEMBER OF
THE FAVORED UNIONS WAS SAFE  THEY GATHERED TOGETHER IN BANDS IN ORDER TO
GO TO WORK OR TO RETURN FROM WORK  THEY WALKED ALWAYS IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE STREET  ON THE SIDEWALK THEY WERE LIABLE TO HAVE THEIR SKULLS
CRUSHED BY BRICKS AND COBBLESTONES THROWN FROM WINDOWS AND HOUSETOPS 
THEY WERE PERMITTED TO CARRY WEAPONS  AND THE AUTHORITIES AIDED THEM
IN EVERY WAY  THEIR PERSECUTORS WERE SENTENCED TO LONG TERMS IN PRISON 
WHERE THEY WERE HARSHLY TREATED WHILE NO MAN  NOT A MEMBER OF THE
FAVORED UNIONS  WAS PERMITTED TO CARRY WEAPONS  VIOLATION OF THIS LAW
WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY 

OUTRAGED LABOR CONTINUED TO WREAK VENGEANCE ON THE TRAITORS  CASTE LINES
FORMED AUTOMATICALLY  THE CHILDREN OF THE TRAITORS WERE PERSECUTED
BY THE CHILDREN OF THE WORKERS WHO HAD BEEN BETRAYED  UNTIL IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE FORMER TO PLAY ON THE STREETS OR TO ATTEND THE PUBLIC
SCHOOLS  ALSO  THE WIVES AND FAMILIES OF THE TRAITORS WERE OSTRACIZED 
WHILE THE CORNER GROCERYMAN WHO SOLD PROVISIONS TO THEM WAS BOYCOTTED 

AS A RESULT  DRIVEN BACK UPON THEMSELVES FROM EVERY SIDE  THE TRAITORS
AND THEIR FAMILIES BECAME CLANNISH  FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DWELL IN
SAFETY IN THE MIDST OF THE BETRAYED PROLETARIAT  THEY MOVED INTO NEW
LOCALITIES INHABITED BY THEMSELVES ALONE  IN THIS THEY WERE FAVORED BY
THE OLIGARCHS  GOOD DWELLINGS  MODERN AND SANITARY  WERE BUILT FOR THEM 
SURROUNDED BY SPACIOUS YARDS  AND SEPARATED HERE AND THERE BY PARKS AND
PLAYGROUNDS  THEIR CHILDREN ATTENDED SCHOOLS ESPECIALLY BUILT FOR
THEM  AND IN THESE SCHOOLS MANUAL TRAINING AND APPLIED SCIENCE WERE
SPECIALIZED UPON  THUS  AND UNAVOIDABLY  AT THE VERY BEGINNING  OUT OF
THIS SEGREGATION AROSE CASTE  THE MEMBERS OF THE FAVORED UNIONS BECAME
THE ARISTOCRACY OF LABOR  THEY WERE SET APART FROM THE REST OF LABOR 
THEY WERE BETTER HOUSED  BETTER CLOTHED  BETTER FED  BETTER TREATED 
THEY WERE GRABSHARING WITH A VENGEANCE 

IN THE MEANTIME  THE REST OF THE WORKING CLASS WAS MORE HARSHLY TREATED 
MANY LITTLE PRIVILEGES WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM IT  WHILE ITS WAGES AND ITS
STANDARD OF LIVING STEADILY SANK DOWN  INCIDENTALLY  ITS PUBLIC SCHOOLS
DETERIORATED  AND EDUCATION SLOWLY CEASED TO BE COMPULSORY  THE INCREASE
IN THE YOUNGER GENERATION OF CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT READ NOR WRITE WAS
PERILOUS 

THE CAPTURE OF THE WORLDMARKET BY THE UNITED STATES HAD DISRUPTED THE
REST OF THE WORLD  INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENTS WERE EVERYWHERE CRASHING
OR TRANSFORMING  GERMANY  ITALY  FRANCE  AUSTRALIA  AND NEW ZEALAND WERE
BUSY FORMING COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTHS  THE BRITISH EMPIRE WAS FALLING
APART  ENGLANDS HANDS WERE FULL  IN INDIA REVOLT WAS IN FULL SWING  THE
CRY IN ALL ASIA WAS  ASIA FOR THE ASIATICS AND BEHIND THIS CRY WAS
JAPAN  EVER URGING AND AIDING THE YELLOW AND BROWN RACES AGAINST THE
WHITE  AND WHILE JAPAN DREAMED OF CONTINENTAL EMPIRE AND STROVE TO
REALIZE THE DREAM  SHE SUPPRESSED HER OWN PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION  IT
WAS A SIMPLE WAR OF THE CASTES  COOLIE VERSUS SAMURAI  AND THE COOLIE
SOCIALISTS WERE EXECUTED BY TENS OF THOUSANDS  FORTY THOUSAND WERE
KILLED IN THE STREETFIGHTING OF TOKIO AND IN THE FUTILE ASSAULT ON
THE MIKADOS PALACE  KOBE WAS A SHAMBLES THE SLAUGHTER OF THE COTTON
OPERATIVES BY MACHINEGUNS BECAME CLASSIC AS THE MOST TERRIFIC EXECUTION
EVER ACHIEVED BY MODERN WAR MACHINES  MOST SAVAGE OF ALL WAS THE
JAPANESE OLIGARCHY THAT AROSE  JAPAN DOMINATED THE EAST  AND TOOK
TO HERSELF THE WHOLE ASIATIC PORTION OF THE WORLDMARKET  WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF INDIA 

ENGLAND MANAGED TO CRUSH HER OWN PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION AND TO HOLD ON
TO INDIA  THOUGH SHE WAS BROUGHT TO THE VERGE OF EXHAUSTION  ALSO  SHE
WAS COMPELLED TO LET HER GREAT COLONIES SLIP AWAY FROM HER  SO IT WAS
THAT THE SOCIALISTS SUCCEEDED IN MAKING AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND INTO
COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTHS  AND IT WAS FOR THE SAME REASON THAT CANADA
WAS LOST TO THE MOTHER COUNTRY  BUT CANADA CRUSHED HER OWN SOCIALIST
REVOLUTION  BEING AIDED IN THIS BY THE IRON HEEL  AT THE SAME TIME  THE
IRON HEEL HELPED MEXICO AND CUBA TO PUT DOWN REVOLT  THE RESULT WAS THAT
THE IRON HEEL WAS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IN THE NEW WORLD  IT HAD WELDED
INTO ONE COMPACT POLITICAL MASS THE WHOLE OF NORTH AMERICA FROM THE
PANAMA CANAL TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN 

AND ENGLAND  AT THE SACRIFICE OF HER GREAT COLONIES  HAD SUCCEEDED ONLY
IN RETAINING INDIA  BUT THIS WAS NO MORE THAN TEMPORARY  THE STRUGGLE
WITH JAPAN AND THE REST OF ASIA FOR INDIA WAS MERELY DELAYED  ENGLAND
WAS DESTINED SHORTLY TO LOSE INDIA  WHILE BEHIND THAT EVENT LOOMED THE
STRUGGLE BETWEEN A UNITED ASIA AND THE WORLD 

AND WHILE ALL THE WORLD WAS TORN WITH CONFLICT  WE OF THE UNITED STATES
WERE NOT PLACID AND PEACEFUL  THE DEFECTION OF THE GREAT UNIONS HAD
PREVENTED OUR PROLETARIAN REVOLT  BUT VIOLENCE WAS EVERYWHERE  IN
ADDITION TO THE LABOR TROUBLES  AND THE DISCONTENT OF THE FARMERS AND OF
THE REMNANT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS  A RELIGIOUS REVIVAL HAD BLAZED UP  AN
OFFSHOOT OF THE SEVENTH DAY ADVENTISTS SPRANG INTO SUDDEN PROMINENCE 
PROCLAIMING THE END OF THE WORLD 

CONFUSION THRICE CONFOUNDED ERNEST CRIED  HOW CAN WE HOPE FOR
SOLIDARITY WITH ALL THESE CROSS PURPOSES AND CONFLICTS

AND TRULY THE RELIGIOUS REVIVAL ASSUMED FORMIDABLE PROPORTIONS  THE
PEOPLE  WHAT OF THEIR WRETCHEDNESS  AND OF THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT IN
ALL THINGS EARTHLY  WERE RIPE AND EAGER FOR A HEAVEN WHERE INDUSTRIAL
TYRANTS ENTERED NO MORE THAN CAMELS PASSED THROUGH NEEDLEEYES 
WILDEYED ITINERANT PREACHERS SWARMED OVER THE LAND AND DESPITE
THE PROHIBITION OF THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES  AND THE PERSECUTION FOR
DISOBEDIENCE  THE FLAMES OF RELIGIOUS FRENZY WERE FANNED BY COUNTLESS
CAMPMEETINGS 

IT WAS THE LAST DAYS  THEY CLAIMED  THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE
WORLD  THE FOUR WINDS HAD BEEN LOOSED  GOD HAD STIRRED THE NATIONS
TO STRIFE  IT WAS A TIME OF VISIONS AND MIRACLES  WHILE SEERS AND
PROPHETESSES WERE LEGION  THE PEOPLE CEASED WORK BY HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS AND FLED TO THE MOUNTAINS  THERE TO AWAIT THE IMMINENT COMING
OF GOD AND THE RISING OF THE HUNDRED AND FORTY AND FOUR THOUSAND TO
HEAVEN  BUT IN THE MEANTIME GOD DID NOT COME  AND THEY STARVED TO DEATH
IN GREAT NUMBERS  IN THEIR DESPERATION THEY RAVAGED THE FARMS FOR FOOD 
AND THE CONSEQUENT TUMULT AND ANARCHY IN THE COUNTRY DISTRICTS BUT
INCREASED THE WOES OF THE POOR EXPROPRIATED FARMERS 

ALSO  THE FARMS AND WAREHOUSES WERE THE PROPERTY OF THE IRON HEEL 
ARMIES OF TROOPS WERE PUT INTO THE FIELD  AND THE FANATICS WERE HERDED
BACK AT THE BAYONET POINT TO THEIR TASKS IN THE CITIES  THERE THEY BROKE
OUT IN EVER RECURRING MOBS AND RIOTS  THEIR LEADERS WERE EXECUTED FOR
SEDITION OR CONFINED IN MADHOUSES  THOSE WHO WERE EXECUTED WENT TO THEIR
DEATHS WITH ALL THE GLADNESS OF MARTYRS  IT WAS A TIME OF MADNESS  THE
UNREST SPREAD  IN THE SWAMPS AND DESERTS AND WASTE PLACES  FROM FLORIDA
TO ALASKA  THE SMALL GROUPS OF INDIANS THAT SURVIVED WERE DANCING GHOST
DANCES AND WAITING THE COMING OF A MESSIAH OF THEIR OWN 

AND THROUGH IT ALL  WITH A SERENITY AND CERTITUDE THAT WAS TERRIFYING 
CONTINUED TO RISE THE FORM OF THAT MONSTER OF THE AGES  THE OLIGARCHY 
WITH IRON HAND AND IRON HEEL IT MASTERED THE SURGING MILLIONS  OUT
OF CONFUSION BROUGHT ORDER  OUT OF THE VERY CHAOS WROUGHT ITS OWN
FOUNDATION AND STRUCTURE 

JUST WAIT TILL WE GET IN  THE GRANGERS SAIDCALVIN SAID IT TO US IN
OUR PELL STREET QUARTERS  LOOK AT THE STATES WEVE CAPTURED  WITH YOU
SOCIALISTS TO BACK US  WELL MAKE THEM SING ANOTHER SONG WHEN WE TAKE
OFFICE 

THE MILLIONS OF THE DISCONTENTED AND THE IMPOVERISHED ARE OURS  THE
SOCIALISTS SAID  THE GRANGERS HAVE COME OVER TO US  THE FARMERS  THE
MIDDLE CLASS  AND THE LABORERS  THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM WILL FALL TO
PIECES  IN ANOTHER MONTH WE SEND FIFTY MEN TO CONGRESS  TWO YEARS
HENCE EVERY OFFICE WILL BE OURS  FROM THE PRESIDENT DOWN TO THE LOCAL
DOGCATCHER 

TO ALL OF WHICH ERNEST WOULD SHAKE HIS HEAD AND SAY 

HOW MANY RIFLES HAVE YOU GOT DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GET PLENTY
OF LEAD WHEN IT COMES TO POWDER  CHEMICAL MIXTURES ARE BETTER THAN
MECHANICAL MIXTURES  YOU TAKE MY WORD 



CHAPTER XVI

THE END


WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR ERNEST AND ME TO GO TO WASHINGTON  FATHER DID NOT
ACCOMPANY US  HE HAD BECOME ENAMOURED OF PROLETARIAN LIFE  HE LOOKED
UPON OUR SLUM NEIGHBORHOOD AS A GREAT SOCIOLOGICAL LABORATORY  AND
HE HAD EMBARKED UPON AN APPARENTLY ENDLESS ORGY OF INVESTIGATION  HE
CHUMMED WITH THE LABORERS  AND WAS AN INTIMATE IN SCORES OF HOMES 
ALSO  HE WORKED AT ODD JOBS  AND THE WORK WAS PLAY AS WELL AS LEARNED
INVESTIGATION  FOR HE DELIGHTED IN IT AND WAS ALWAYS RETURNING HOME WITH
COPIOUS NOTES AND BUBBLING OVER WITH NEW ADVENTURES  HE WAS THE PERFECT
SCIENTIST 

THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HIS WORKING AT ALL  BECAUSE ERNEST MANAGED TO EARN
ENOUGH FROM HIS TRANSLATING TO TAKE CARE OF THE THREE OF US  BUT FATHER
INSISTED ON PURSUING HIS FAVORITE PHANTOM  AND A PROTEAN PHANTOM IT WAS 
JUDGING FROM THE JOBS HE WORKED AT  I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE EVENING HE
BROUGHT HOME HIS STREET PEDLERS OUTFIT OF SHOELACES AND SUSPENDERS 
NOR THE TIME I WENT INTO THE LITTLE CORNER GROCERY TO MAKE SOME PURCHASE
AND HAD HIM WAIT ON ME  AFTER THAT I WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN HE TENDED
BAR FOR A WEEK IN THE SALOON ACROSS THE STREET  HE WORKED AS A NIGHT
WATCHMAN  HAWKED POTATOES ON THE STREET  PASTED LABELS IN A CANNERY
WAREHOUSE  WAS UTILITY MAN IN A PAPERBOX FACTORY  AND WATERCARRIER
FOR A STREET RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION GANG  AND EVEN JOINED THE DISHWASHERS
UNION JUST BEFORE IT FELL TO PIECES 

I THINK THE BISHOPS EXAMPLE  SO FAR AS WEARING APPAREL WAS CONCERNED 
MUST HAVE FASCINATED FATHER  FOR HE WORE THE CHEAP COTTON SHIRT OF THE
LABORER AND THE OVERALLS WITH THE NARROW STRAP ABOUT THE HIPS  YET ONE
HABIT REMAINED TO HIM FROM THE OLD LIFE HE ALWAYS DRESSED FOR DINNER 
OR SUPPER  RATHER 

I COULD BE HAPPY ANYWHERE WITH ERNEST AND FATHERS HAPPINESS IN OUR
CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES ROUNDED OUT MY OWN HAPPINESS 

WHEN I WAS A BOY  FATHER SAID  I WAS VERY CURIOUS  I WANTED TO KNOW
WHY THINGS WERE AND HOW THEY CAME TO PASS  THAT WAS WHY I BECAME A
PHYSICIST  THE LIFE IN ME TODAY IS JUST AS CURIOUS AS IT WAS IN MY
BOYHOOD  AND ITS THE BEING CURIOUS THAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING 

SOMETIMES HE VENTURED NORTH OF MARKET STREET INTO THE SHOPPING AND
THEATRE DISTRICT  WHERE HE SOLD PAPERS  RAN ERRANDS  AND OPENED CABS 
THERE  ONE DAY  CLOSING A CAB  HE ENCOUNTERED MR  WICKSON  IN HIGH GLEE
FATHER DESCRIBED THE INCIDENT TO US THAT EVENING 

WICKSON LOOKED AT ME SHARPLY WHEN I CLOSED THE DOOR ON HIM  AND
MUTTERED  WELL  ILL BE DAMNED  JUST LIKE THAT HE SAID IT  WELL  ILL
BE DAMNED  HIS FACE TURNED RED AND HE WAS SO CONFUSED THAT HE FORGOT TO
TIP ME  BUT HE MUST HAVE RECOVERED HIMSELF QUICKLY  FOR THE CAB HADNT
GONE FIFTY FEET BEFORE IT TURNED AROUND AND CAME BACK  HE LEANED OUT OF
THE DOOR 

LOOK HERE  PROFESSOR  HE SAID  THIS IS TOO MUCH  WHAT CAN I DO FOR
YOU

I CLOSED THE CAB DOOR FOR YOU  I ANSWERED  ACCORDING TO COMMON
CUSTOM YOU MIGHT GIVE ME A DIME 

BOTHER THAT HE SNORTED  I MEAN SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL 

HE WAS CERTAINLY SERIOUSA TWINGE OF OSSIFIED CONSCIENCE OR SOMETHING
AND SO I CONSIDERED WITH GRAVE DELIBERATION FOR A MOMENT 

HIS FACE WAS QUITE EXPECTANT WHEN I BEGAN MY ANSWER  BUT YOU SHOULD
HAVE SEEN IT WHEN I FINISHED 

YOU MIGHT GIVE ME BACK MY HOME  I SAID  AND MY STOCK IN THE SIERRA
MILLS 

FATHER PAUSED 

WHAT DID HE SAY I QUESTIONED EAGERLY 

WHAT COULD HE SAY HE SAID NOTHING  BUT I SAID  I HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY 
HE LOOKED AT ME CURIOUSLY  TELL ME  ARE YOU HAPPY I ASKED 

HE ORDERED THE CABMAN TO DRIVE ON  AND WENT AWAY SWEARING HORRIBLY  AND
HE DIDNT GIVE ME THE DIME  MUCH LESS THE HOME AND STOCK SO YOU SEE  MY
DEAR  YOUR FATHERS STREETARAB CAREER IS BESET WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS 

AND SO IT WAS THAT FATHER KEPT ON AT OUR PELL STREET QUARTERS  WHILE
ERNEST AND I WENT TO WASHINGTON  EXCEPT FOR THE FINAL CONSUMMATION  THE
OLD ORDER HAD PASSED AWAY  AND THE FINAL CONSUMMATION WAS NEARER THAN
I DREAMED  CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATION  NO OBSTACLES WERE RAISED TO
PREVENT THE SOCIALIST CONGRESSMEN FROM TAKING THEIR SEATS  EVERYTHING
WENT SMOOTHLY  AND I LAUGHED AT ERNEST WHEN HE LOOKED UPON THE VERY
SMOOTHNESS AS SOMETHING OMINOUS 

WE FOUND OUR SOCIALIST COMRADES CONFIDENT  OPTIMISTIC OF THEIR STRENGTH
AND OF THE THINGS THEY WOULD ACCOMPLISH  A FEW GRANGERS WHO HAD BEEN
ELECTED TO CONGRESS INCREASED OUR STRENGTH  AND AN ELABORATE PROGRAMME
OF WHAT WAS TO BE DONE WAS PREPARED BY THE UNITED FORCES  IN ALL OF
WHICH ERNEST JOINED LOYALLY AND ENERGETICALLY  THOUGH HE COULD NOT
FORBEAR  NOW AND AGAIN  FROM SAYING  APROPOS OF NOTHING IN PARTICULAR 
WHEN IT COMES TO POWDER  CHEMICAL MIXTURES ARE BETTER THAN MECHANICAL
MIXTURES  YOU TAKE MY WORD 

THE TROUBLE AROSE FIRST WITH THE GRANGERS IN THE VARIOUS STATES THEY HAD
CAPTURED AT THE LAST ELECTION  THERE WERE A DOZEN OF THESE STATES  BUT
THE GRANGERS WHO HAD BEEN ELECTED WERE NOT PERMITTED TO TAKE OFFICE  THE
INCUMBENTS REFUSED TO GET OUT  IT WAS VERY SIMPLE  THEY MERELY CHARGED
ILLEGALITY IN THE ELECTIONS AND WRAPPED UP THE WHOLE SITUATION IN THE
INTERMINABLE RED TAPE OF THE LAW  THE GRANGERS WERE POWERLESS  THE
COURTS WERE IN THE HANDS OF THEIR ENEMIES 

THIS WAS THE MOMENT OF DANGER  IF THE CHEATED GRANGERS BECAME VIOLENT 
ALL WAS LOST  HOW WE SOCIALISTS WORKED TO HOLD THEM BACK THERE WERE
DAYS AND NIGHTS WHEN ERNEST NEVER CLOSED HIS EYES IN SLEEP  THE BIG
LEADERS OF THE GRANGERS SAW THE PERIL AND WERE WITH US TO A MAN  BUT
IT WAS ALL OF NO AVAIL  THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE  AND IT SET
ITS AGENTSPROVOCATEURS TO WORK  WITHOUT DISCUSSION  IT WAS THE
AGENTSPROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT 

IN A DOZEN STATES THE REVOLT FLARED UP  THE EXPROPRIATED FARMERS
TOOK FORCIBLE POSSESSION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS  OF COURSE THIS WAS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL  AND OF COURSE THE UNITED STATES PUT ITS SOLDIERS INTO
THE FIELD  EVERYWHERE THE AGENTSPROVOCATEURS URGED THE PEOPLE ON  THESE
EMISSARIES OF THE IRON HEEL DISGUISED THEMSELVES AS ARTISANS  FARMERS 
AND FARM LABORERS  IN SACRAMENTO  THE CAPITAL OF CALIFORNIA  THE
GRANGERS HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAINTAINING ORDER  THOUSANDS OF SECRET AGENTS
WERE RUSHED TO THE DEVOTED CITY  IN MOBS COMPOSED WHOLLY OF THEMSELVES 
THEY FIRED AND LOOTED BUILDINGS AND FACTORIES  THEY WORKED THE PEOPLE
UP UNTIL THEY JOINED THEM IN THE PILLAGE  LIQUOR IN LARGE QUANTITIES WAS
DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE SLUM CLASSES FURTHER TO INFLAME THEIR MINDS  AND
THEN  WHEN ALL WAS READY  APPEARED UPON THE SCENE THE SOLDIERS OF THE
UNITED STATES  WHO WERE  IN REALITY  THE SOLDIERS OF THE IRON HEEL 
ELEVEN THOUSAND MEN  WOMEN  AND CHILDREN WERE SHOT DOWN ON THE STREETS
OF SACRAMENTO OR MURDERED IN THEIR HOUSES  THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TOOK
POSSESSION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT  AND ALL WAS OVER FOR CALIFORNIA 

AND AS WITH CALIFORNIA  SO ELSEWHERE  EVERY GRANGER STATE WAS RAVAGED
WITH VIOLENCE AND WASHED IN BLOOD  FIRST  DISORDER WAS PRECIPITATED BY
THE SECRET AGENTS AND THE BLACK HUNDREDS  THEN THE TROOPS WERE CALLED
OUT  RIOTING AND MOBRULE REIGNED THROUGHOUT THE RURAL DISTRICTS  DAY
AND NIGHT THE SMOKE OF BURNING FARMS  WAREHOUSES  VILLAGES  AND CITIES
FILLED THE SKY  DYNAMITE APPEARED  RAILROAD BRIDGES AND TUNNELS WERE
BLOWN UP AND TRAINS WERE WRECKED  THE POOR FARMERS WERE SHOT AND HANGED
IN GREAT NUMBERS  REPRISALS WERE BITTER  AND MANY PLUTOCRATS AND ARMY
OFFICERS WERE MURDERED  BLOOD AND VENGEANCE WERE IN MENS HEARTS  THE
REGULAR TROOPS FOUGHT THE FARMERS AS SAVAGELY AS HAD THEY BEEN INDIANS 
AND THE REGULAR TROOPS HAD CAUSE  TWENTYEIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM HAD BEEN
ANNIHILATED IN A TREMENDOUS SERIES OF DYNAMITE EXPLOSIONS IN OREGON 
AND IN A SIMILAR MANNER  A NUMBER OF TRAIN LOADS  AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND
PLACES  HAD BEEN DESTROYED  SO IT WAS THAT THE REGULAR TROOPS FOUGHT FOR
THEIR LIVES AS WELL AS DID THE FARMERS 

AS FOR THE MILITIA  THE MILITIA LAW OF  WAS PUT INTO EFFECT  AND THE
WORKERS OF ONE STATE WERE COMPELLED  UNDER PAIN OF DEATH  TO SHOOT DOWN
THEIR COMRADEWORKERS IN OTHER STATES  OF COURSE  THE MILITIA LAW DID
NOT WORK SMOOTHLY AT FIRST  MANY MILITIA OFFICERS WERE MURDERED  AND
MANY MILITIAMEN WERE EXECUTED BY DRUMHEAD COURT MARTIAL  ERNESTS
PROPHECY WAS STRIKINGLY FULFILLED IN THE CASES OF MR  KOWALT AND MR 
ASMUNSEN  BOTH WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE MILITIA  AND BOTH WERE DRAFTED TO
SERVE IN THE PUNITIVE EXPEDITION THAT WAS DESPATCHED FROM CALIFORNIA
AGAINST THE FARMERS OF MISSOURI  MR  KOWALT AND MR  ASMUNSEN REFUSED TO
SERVE  THEY WERE GIVEN SHORT SHRIFT  DRUMHEAD COURT MARTIAL WAS THEIR
PORTION  AND MILITARY EXECUTION THEIR END  THEY WERE SHOT WITH THEIR
BACKS TO THE FIRING SQUAD 

MANY YOUNG MEN FLED INTO THE MOUNTAINS TO ESCAPE SERVING IN THE MILITIA 
THERE THEY BECAME OUTLAWS  AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL MORE PEACEFUL TIMES THAT
THEY RECEIVED THEIR PUNISHMENT  IT WAS DRASTIC  THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED A
PROCLAMATION FOR ALL LAWABIDING CITIZENS TO COME IN FROM THE MOUNTAINS
FOR A PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS  WHEN THE PROCLAIMED DATE ARRIVED  HALF A
MILLION SOLDIERS WERE SENT INTO THE MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICTS EVERYWHERE 
THERE WAS NO INVESTIGATION  NO TRIAL  WHEREVER A MAN WAS ENCOUNTERED  HE
WAS SHOT DOWN ON THE SPOT  THE TROOPS OPERATED ON THE BASIS THAT NO
MAN NOT AN OUTLAW REMAINED IN THE MOUNTAINS  SOME BANDS  IN STRONG
POSITIONS  FOUGHT GALLANTLY  BUT IN THE END EVERY DESERTER FROM THE
MILITIA MET DEATH 

A MORE IMMEDIATE LESSON  HOWEVER  WAS IMPRESSED ON THE MINDS OF THE
PEOPLE BY THE PUNISHMENT METED OUT TO THE KANSAS MILITIA  THE GREAT
KANSAS MUTINY OCCURRED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF MILITARY OPERATIONS
AGAINST THE GRANGERS  SIX THOUSAND OF THE MILITIA MUTINIED  THEY HAD
BEEN FOR SEVERAL WEEKS VERY TURBULENT AND SULLEN  AND FOR THAT REASON
HAD BEEN KEPT IN CAMP  THEIR OPEN MUTINY  HOWEVER  WAS WITHOUT DOUBT
PRECIPITATED BY THE AGENTSPROVOCATEURS 

ON THE NIGHT OF THE D OF APRIL THEY AROSE AND MURDERED THEIR OFFICERS 
ONLY A SMALL REMNANT OF THE LATTER ESCAPING  THIS WAS BEYOND THE SCHEME
OF THE IRON HEEL  FOR THE AGENTSPROVOCATEURS HAD DONE THEIR WORK TOO
WELL  BUT EVERYTHING WAS GRIST TO THE IRON HEEL  IT HAD PREPARED FOR THE
OUTBREAK  AND THE KILLING OF SO MANY OFFICERS GAVE IT JUSTIFICATION FOR
WHAT FOLLOWED  AS BY MAGIC  FORTY THOUSAND SOLDIERS OF THE REGULAR ARMY
SURROUNDED THE MALCONTENTS  IT WAS A TRAP  THE WRETCHED MILITIAMEN FOUND
THAT THEIR MACHINEGUNS HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH  AND THAT THE CARTRIDGES
FROM THE CAPTURED MAGAZINES DID NOT FIT THEIR RIFLES  THEY HOISTED THE
WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER  BUT IT WAS IGNORED  THERE WERE NO SURVIVORS 
THE ENTIRE SIX THOUSAND WERE ANNIHILATED  COMMON SHELL AND SHRAPNEL WERE
THROWN IN UPON THEM FROM A DISTANCE  AND  WHEN  IN THEIR DESPERATION 
THEY CHARGED THE ENCIRCLING LINES  THEY WERE MOWED DOWN BY THE
MACHINEGUNS  I TALKED WITH AN EYEWITNESS  AND HE SAID THAT THE NEAREST
ANY MILITIAMAN APPROACHED THE MACHINEGUNS WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
YARDS  THE EARTH WAS CARPETED WITH THE SLAIN  AND A FINAL CHARGE OF
CAVALRY  WITH TRAMPLING OF HORSES HOOFS  REVOLVERS  AND SABRES  CRUSHED
THE WOUNDED INTO THE GROUND 

SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF THE GRANGERS CAME THE REVOLT
OF THE COAL MINERS  IT WAS THE EXPIRING EFFORT OF ORGANIZED LABOR 
THREEQUARTERS OF A MILLION OF MINERS WENT OUT ON STRIKE  BUT THEY
WERE TOO WIDELY SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY TO ADVANTAGE FROM THEIR OWN
STRENGTH  THEY WERE SEGREGATED IN THEIR OWN DISTRICTS AND BEATEN INTO
SUBMISSION  THIS WAS THE FIRST GREAT SLAVEDRIVE  POCOCK WON HIS SPURS
AS A SLAVEDRIVER AND EARNED THE UNDYING HATRED OF THE PROLETARIAT 
COUNTLESS ATTEMPTS WERE MADE UPON HIS LIFE  BUT HE SEEMED TO BEAR A
CHARMED EXISTENCE  IT WAS HE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INTRODUCTION
OF THE RUSSIAN PASSPORT SYSTEM AMONG THE MINERS  AND THE DENIAL OF THEIR
RIGHT OF REMOVAL FROM ONE PART OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER 

      ALBERT POCOCK  ANOTHER OF THE NOTORIOUS STRIKEBREAKERS OF
     EARLIER YEARS  WHO  TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH  SUCCESSFULLY
     HELD ALL THE COALMINERS OF THE COUNTRY TO THEIR TASK   HE
     WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON  LEWIS POCOCK  AND FOR FIVE
     GENERATIONS THIS REMARKABLE LINE OF SLAVEDRIVERS HANDLED
     THE COAL MINES   THE ELDER POCOCK  KNOWN AS POCOCK I   HAS
     BEEN DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS  A LONG  LEAN HEAD  SEMICIRCLED
     BY A FRINGE OF BROWN AND GRAY HAIR  WITH BIG CHEEKBONES AND
     A HEAVY CHIN        A PALE FACE  LUSTRELESS GRAY EYES  A
     METALLIC VOICE  AND A LANGUID MANNER   HE WAS BORN OF
     HUMBLE PARENTS  AND BEGAN HIS CAREER AS A BARTENDER   HE
     NEXT BECAME A PRIVATE DETECTIVE FOR A STREET RAILWAY
     CORPORATION  AND BY SUCCESSIVE STEPS DEVELOPED INTO A
     PROFESSIONAL STRIKEBREAKER  POCOCK V   THE LAST OF THE LINE 
     WAS BLOWN UP IN A PUMPHOUSE BY A BOMB DURING A PETTY REVOLT
     OF THE MINERS IN THE INDIAN TERRITORY  THIS OCCURRED IN 
     A D 

IN THE MEANTIME  THE SOCIALISTS HELD FIRM  WHILE THE GRANGERS EXPIRED IN
FLAME AND BLOOD  AND ORGANIZED LABOR WAS DISRUPTED  THE SOCIALISTS
HELD THEIR PEACE AND PERFECTED THEIR SECRET ORGANIZATION  IN VAIN THE
GRANGERS PLEADED WITH US  WE RIGHTLY CONTENDED THAT ANY REVOLT ON OUR
PART WAS VIRTUALLY SUICIDE FOR THE WHOLE REVOLUTION  THE IRON HEEL  AT
FIRST DUBIOUS ABOUT DEALING WITH THE ENTIRE PROLETARIAT AT ONE TIME  HAD
FOUND THE WORK EASIER THAN IT HAD EXPECTED  AND WOULD HAVE ASKED NOTHING
BETTER THAN AN UPRISING ON OUR PART  BUT WE AVOIDED THE ISSUE  IN SPITE
OF THE FACT THAT AGENTSPROVOCATEURS SWARMED IN OUR MIDST  IN THOSE
EARLY DAYS  THE AGENTS OF THE IRON HEEL WERE CLUMSY IN THEIR METHODS 
THEY HAD MUCH TO LEARN AND IN THE MEANTIME OUR FIGHTING GROUPS WEEDED
THEM OUT  IT WAS BITTER  BLOODY WORK  BUT WE WERE FIGHTING FOR LIFE AND
FOR THE REVOLUTION  AND WE HAD TO FIGHT THE ENEMY WITH ITS OWN WEAPONS 
YET WE WERE FAIR  NO AGENT OF THE IRON HEEL WAS EXECUTED WITHOUT A
TRIAL  WE MAY HAVE MADE MISTAKES  BUT IF SO  VERY RARELY  THE BRAVEST 
AND THE MOST COMBATIVE AND SELFSACRIFICING OF OUR COMRADES WENT INTO
THE FIGHTING GROUPS  ONCE  AFTER TEN YEARS HAD PASSED  ERNEST MADE A
CALCULATION FROM FIGURES FURNISHED BY THE CHIEFS OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS 
AND HIS CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE AVERAGE LIFE OF A MAN OR WOMAN AFTER
BECOMING A MEMBER WAS FIVE YEARS  THE COMRADES OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS
WERE HEROES ALL  AND THE PECULIAR THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT THEY WERE
OPPOSED TO THE TAKING OF LIFE  THEY VIOLATED THEIR OWN NATURES  YET THEY
LOVED LIBERTY AND KNEW OF NO SACRIFICE TOO GREAT TO MAKE FOR THE CAUSE 

      THESE FIGHTING GROUPS WERE MODELLED SOMEWHAT AFTER THE
     FIGHTING ORGANIZATION OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION  AND 
     DESPITE THE UNCEASING EFFORTS OF THE IRON HEEL  THESE GROUPS
     PERSISTED THROUGHOUT THE THREE CENTURIES OF ITS EXISTENCE 
     COMPOSED OF MEN AND WOMEN ACTUATED BY LOFTY PURPOSE AND
     UNAFRAID TO DIE  THE FIGHTING GROUPS EXERCISED TREMENDOUS
     INFLUENCE AND TEMPERED THE SAVAGE BRUTALITY OF THE RULERS 
     NOT ALONE WAS THEIR WORK CONFINED TO UNSEEN WARFARE WITH THE
     SECRET AGENTS OF THE OLIGARCHY   THE OLIGARCHS THEMSELVES
     WERE COMPELLED TO LISTEN TO THE DECREES OF THE GROUPS  AND
     OFTEN  WHEN THEY DISOBEYED  WERE PUNISHED BY DEATHAND
     LIKEWISE WITH THE SUBORDINATES OF THE OLIGARCHS  WITH THE
     OFFICERS OF THE ARMY AND THE LEADERS OF THE LABOR CASTES 

     STERN JUSTICE WAS METED OUT BY THESE ORGANIZED AVENGERS  BUT
     MOST REMARKABLE WAS THEIR PASSIONLESS AND JUDICIAL
     PROCEDURE   THERE WERE NO SNAP JUDGMENTS   WHEN A MAN WAS
     CAPTURED HE WAS GIVEN FAIR TRIAL AND OPPORTUNITY FOR
     DEFENCE   OF NECESSITY  MANY MEN WERE TRIED AND CONDEMNED BY
     PROXY  AS IN THE CASE OF GENERAL LAMPTON  THIS OCCURRED IN
      A D   POSSIBLY THE MOST BLOODTHIRSTY AND MALIGNANT OF
     ALL THE MERCENARIES THAT EVER SERVED THE IRON HEEL  HE WAS
     INFORMED BY THE FIGHTING GROUPS THAT THEY HAD TRIED HIM 
     FOUND HIM GUILTY  AND CONDEMNED HIM TO DEATHAND THIS 
     AFTER THREE WARNINGS FOR HIM TO CEASE FROM HIS FEROCIOUS
     TREATMENT OF THE PROLETARIAT   AFTER HIS CONDEMNATION HE
     SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH A MYRIAD PROTECTIVE DEVICES   YEARS
     PASSED  AND IN VAIN THE FIGHTING GROUPS STROVE TO EXECUTE
     THEIR DECREE   COMRADE AFTER COMRADE  MEN AND WOMEN  FAILED
     IN THEIR ATTEMPTS  AND WERE CRUELLY EXECUTED BY THE
     OLIGARCHY   IT WAS THE CASE OF GENERAL LAMPTON THAT REVIVED
     CRUCIFIXION AS A LEGAL METHOD OF EXECUTION   BUT IN THE END
     THE CONDEMNED MAN FOUND HIS EXECUTIONER IN THE FORM OF A
     SLENDER GIRL OF SEVENTEEN  MADELINE PROVENCE  WHO  TO
     ACCOMPLISH HER PURPOSE  SERVED TWO YEARS IN HIS PALACE AS A
     SEAMSTRESS TO THE HOUSEHOLD  SHE DIED IN SOLITARY
     CONFINEMENT AFTER HORRIBLE AND PROLONGED TORTURE BUT TODAY
     SHE STANDS IN IMPERISHABLE BRONZE IN THE PANTHEON OF
     BROTHERHOOD IN THE WONDER CITY OF SERLES 

     WE  WHO BY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE KNOW NOTHING OF BLOODSHED 
     MUST NOT JUDGE HARSHLY THE HEROES OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS 
     THEY GAVE UP THEIR LIVES FOR HUMANITY  NO SACRIFICE WAS TOO
     GREAT FOR THEM TO ACCOMPLISH  WHILE INEXORABLE NECESSITY
     COMPELLED THEM TO BLOODY EXPRESSION IN AN AGE OF BLOOD   THE
     FIGHTING GROUPS CONSTITUTED THE ONE THORN IN THE SIDE OF THE
     IRON HEEL THAT THE IRON HEEL COULD NEVER REMOVE   EVERHARD
     WAS THE FATHER OF THIS CURIOUS ARMY  AND ITS ACCOMPLISHMENTS
     AND SUCCESSFUL PERSISTENCE FOR THREE HUNDRED YEARS BEAR
     WITNESS TO THE WISDOM WITH WHICH HE ORGANIZED AND THE SOLID
     FOUNDATION HE LAID FOR THE SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS TO BUILD
     UPON   IN SOME RESPECTS  DESPITE HIS GREAT ECONOMIC AND
     SOCIOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS  AND HIS WORK AS A GENERAL LEADER
     IN THE REVOLUTION  HIS ORGANIZATION OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS
     MUST BE REGARDED AS HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT 

THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD  FIRST  THE WEEDING OUT FROM OUR
CIRCLES OF THE SECRET AGENTS OF THE OLIGARCHY  SECOND  THE ORGANIZING
OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS  AND OUTSIDE OF THEM  OF THE GENERAL SECRET
ORGANIZATION OF THE REVOLUTION  AND THIRD  THE INTRODUCTION OF OUR OWN
SECRET AGENTS INTO EVERY BRANCH OF THE OLIGARCHYINTO THE LABOR CASTES
AND ESPECIALLY AMONG THE TELEGRAPHERS AND SECRETARIES AND CLERKS  INTO
THE ARMY  THE AGENTSPROVOCATEURS  AND THE SLAVEDRIVERS  IT WAS SLOW
WORK  AND PERILOUS  AND OFTEN WERE OUR EFFORTS REWARDED WITH COSTLY
FAILURES 

THE IRON HEEL HAD TRIUMPHED IN OPEN WARFARE  BUT WE HELD OUR OWN IN THE
NEW WARFARE  STRANGE AND AWFUL AND SUBTERRANEAN  THAT WE INSTITUTED 
ALL WAS UNSEEN  MUCH WAS UNGUESSED THE BLIND FOUGHT THE BLIND AND
YET THROUGH IT ALL WAS ORDER  PURPOSE  CONTROL  WE PERMEATED THE
ENTIRE ORGANIZATION OF THE IRON HEEL WITH OUR AGENTS  WHILE OUR OWN
ORGANIZATION WAS PERMEATED WITH THE AGENTS OF THE IRON HEEL  IT WAS
WARFARE DARK AND DEVIOUS  REPLETE WITH INTRIGUE AND CONSPIRACY  PLOT
AND COUNTERPLOT  AND BEHIND ALL  EVER MENACING  WAS DEATH  VIOLENT AND
TERRIBLE  MEN AND WOMEN DISAPPEARED  OUR NEAREST AND DEAREST COMRADES 
WE SAW THEM TODAY  TOMORROW THEY WERE GONE WE NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN 
AND WE KNEW THAT THEY HAD DIED 

THERE WAS NO TRUST  NO CONFIDENCE ANYWHERE  THE MAN WHO PLOTTED BESIDE
US  FOR ALL WE KNEW  MIGHT BE AN AGENT OF THE IRON HEEL  WE MINED THE
ORGANIZATION OF THE IRON HEEL WITH OUR SECRET AGENTS  AND THE IRON HEEL
COUNTERMINED WITH ITS SECRET AGENTS INSIDE ITS OWN ORGANIZATION  AND
IT WAS THE SAME WITH OUR ORGANIZATION  AND DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF
CONFIDENCE AND TRUST WE WERE COMPELLED TO BASE OUR EVERY EFFORT ON
CONFIDENCE AND TRUST  OFTEN WERE WE BETRAYED  MEN WERE WEAK  THE IRON
HEEL COULD OFFER MONEY  LEISURE  THE JOYS AND PLEASURES THAT WAITED
IN THE REPOSE OF THE WONDER CITIES  WE COULD OFFER NOTHING BUT THE
SATISFACTION OF BEING FAITHFUL TO A NOBLE IDEAL  AS FOR THE REST  THE
WAGES OF THOSE WHO WERE LOYAL WERE UNCEASING PERIL  TORTURE  AND DEATH 

MEN WERE WEAK  I SAY  AND BECAUSE OF THEIR WEAKNESS WE WERE COMPELLED TO
MAKE THE ONLY OTHER REWARD THAT WAS WITHIN OUR POWER  IT WAS THE REWARD
OF DEATH  OUT OF NECESSITY WE HAD TO PUNISH OUR TRAITORS  FOR EVERY MAN
WHO BETRAYED US  FROM ONE TO A DOZEN FAITHFUL AVENGERS WERE LOOSED UPON
HIS HEELS  WE MIGHT FAIL TO CARRY OUT OUR DECREES AGAINST OUR ENEMIES 
SUCH AS THE POCOCKS  FOR INSTANCE BUT THE ONE THING WE COULD NOT AFFORD
TO FAIL IN WAS THE PUNISHMENT OF OUR OWN TRAITORS  COMRADES TURNED
TRAITOR BY PERMISSION  IN ORDER TO WIN TO THE WONDER CITIES AND THERE
EXECUTE OUR SENTENCES ON THE REAL TRAITORS  IN FACT  SO TERRIBLE DID
WE MAKE OURSELVES  THAT IT BECAME A GREATER PERIL TO BETRAY US THAN TO
REMAIN LOYAL TO US 

THE REVOLUTION TOOK ON LARGELY THE CHARACTER OF RELIGION  WE WORSHIPPED
AT THE SHRINE OF THE REVOLUTION  WHICH WAS THE SHRINE OF LIBERTY  IT WAS
THE DIVINE FLASHING THROUGH US  MEN AND WOMEN DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO
THE CAUSE  AND NEWBORN BABES WERE SEALED TO IT AS OF OLD THEY HAD BEEN
SEALED TO THE SERVICE OF GOD  WE WERE LOVERS OF HUMANITY 



CHAPTER XVII

THE SCARLET LIVERY


WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF THE GRANGER STATES  THE GRANGERS IN CONGRESS
DISAPPEARED  THEY WERE BEING TRIED FOR HIGH TREASON  AND THEIR PLACES
WERE TAKEN BY THE CREATURES OF THE IRON HEEL  THE SOCIALISTS WERE IN A
PITIFUL MINORITY  AND THEY KNEW THAT THEIR END WAS NEAR  CONGRESS AND
THE SENATE WERE EMPTY PRETENCES  FARCES  PUBLIC QUESTIONS WERE GRAVELY
DEBATED AND PASSED UPON ACCORDING TO THE OLD FORMS  WHILE IN REALITY ALL
THAT WAS DONE WAS TO GIVE THE STAMP OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURE TO THE
MANDATES OF THE OLIGARCHY 

ERNEST WAS IN THE THICK OF THE FIGHT WHEN THE END CAME  IT WAS IN THE
DEBATE ON THE BILL TO ASSIST THE UNEMPLOYED  THE HARD TIMES OF THE
PRECEDING YEAR HAD THRUST GREAT MASSES OF THE PROLETARIAT BENEATH THE
STARVATION LINE  AND THE CONTINUED AND WIDEREACHING DISORDER HAD BUT
SUNK THEM DEEPER  MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WERE STARVING  WHILE THE OLIGARCHS
AND THEIR SUPPORTERS WERE SURFEITING ON THE SURPLUS  WE CALLED THESE
WRETCHED PEOPLE THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  AND IT WAS TO ALLEVIATE THEIR
AWFUL SUFFERING THAT THE SOCIALISTS HAD INTRODUCED THE UNEMPLOYED BILL 
BUT THIS WAS NOT TO THE FANCY OF THE IRON HEEL  IN ITS OWN WAY IT WAS
PREPARING TO SET THESE MILLIONS TO WORK  BUT THE WAY WAS NOT OUR WAY 
WHEREFORE IT HAD ISSUED ITS ORDERS THAT OUR BILL SHOULD BE VOTED DOWN 
ERNEST AND HIS FELLOWS KNEW THAT THEIR EFFORT WAS FUTILE  BUT THEY
WERE TIRED OF THE SUSPENSE  THEY WANTED SOMETHING TO HAPPEN  THEY WERE
ACCOMPLISHING NOTHING  AND THE BEST THEY HOPED FOR WAS THE PUTTING OF AN
END TO THE LEGISLATIVE FARCE IN WHICH THEY WERE UNWILLING PLAYERS 
THEY KNEW NOT WHAT END WOULD COME  BUT THEY NEVER ANTICIPATED A MORE
DISASTROUS END THAN THE ONE THAT DID COME 

      THE SAME CONDITIONS OBTAINED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
     A D  UNDER BRITISH RULE IN INDIA   THE NATIVES DIED OF
     STARVATION BY THE MILLION  WHILE THEIR RULERS ROBBED THEM OF
     THE FRUITS OF THEIR TOIL AND EXPENDED IT ON MAGNIFICENT
     PAGEANTS AND MUMBOJUMBO FOOLERIES  PERFORCE  IN THIS
     ENLIGHTENED AGE  WE HAVE MUCH TO BLUSH FOR IN THE ACTS OF
     OUR ANCESTORS   OUR ONLY CONSOLATION IS PHILOSOPHIC   WE
     MUST ACCEPT THE CAPITALISTIC STAGE IN SOCIAL EVOLUTION AS
     ABOUT ON A PAR WITH THE EARLIER MONKEY STAGE   THE HUMAN HAD
     TO PASS THROUGH THOSE STAGES IN ITS RISE FROM THE MIRE AND
     SLIME OF LOW ORGANIC LIFE   IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT MUCH OF
     THE MIRE AND SLIME SHOULD CLING AND BE NOT EASILY SHAKEN
     OFF 

      THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSSTHIS PHRASE WAS STRUCK OUT BY
     THE GENIUS OF H  G  WELLS IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY
     A D   WELLS WAS A SOCIOLOGICAL SEER  SANE AND NORMAL AS WELL
     AS WARM HUMAN  MANY FRAGMENTS OF HIS WORK HAVE COME DOWN TO
     US  WHILE TWO OF HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS  ANTICIPATIONS
     AND MANKIND IN THE MAKING  HAVE COME DOWN INTACT   BEFORE
     THE OLIGARCHS  AND BEFORE EVERHARD  WELLS SPECULATED UPON
     THE BUILDING OF THE WONDER CITIES  THOUGH IN HIS WRITINGS
     THEY ARE REFERRED TO AS PLEASURE CITIES 

I SAT IN THE GALLERY THAT DAY  WE ALL KNEW THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE WAS
IMMINENT  IT WAS IN THE AIR  AND ITS PRESENCE WAS MADE VISIBLE BY THE
ARMED SOLDIERS DRAWN UP IN LINES IN THE CORRIDORS  AND BY THE OFFICERS
GROUPED IN THE ENTRANCES TO THE HOUSE ITSELF  THE OLIGARCHY WAS ABOUT
TO STRIKE  ERNEST WAS SPEAKING  HE WAS DESCRIBING THE SUFFERINGS OF
THE UNEMPLOYED  AS IF WITH THE WILD IDEA OF IN SOME WAY TOUCHING THEIR
HEARTS AND CONSCIENCES BUT THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS
SNEERED AND JEERED AT HIM  AND THERE WAS UPROAR AND CONFUSION  ERNEST
ABRUPTLY CHANGED FRONT 

I KNOW NOTHING THAT I MAY SAY CAN INFLUENCE YOU  HE SAID  YOU HAVE NO
SOULS TO BE INFLUENCED  YOU ARE SPINELESS  FLACCID THINGS  YOU POMPOUSLY
CALL YOURSELVES REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS  THERE IS NO REPUBLICAN PARTY 
THERE IS NO DEMOCRATIC PARTY  THERE ARE NO REPUBLICANS NOR DEMOCRATS IN
THIS HOUSE  YOU ARE LICKSPITTLERS AND PANDERERS  THE CREATURES OF THE
PLUTOCRACY  YOU TALK VERBOSELY IN ANTIQUATED TERMINOLOGY OF YOUR LOVE
OF LIBERTY  AND ALL THE WHILE YOU WEAR THE SCARLET LIVERY OF THE IRON
HEEL 

HERE THE SHOUTING AND THE CRIES OF ORDER ORDER DROWNED HIS VOICE 
AND HE STOOD DISDAINFULLY TILL THE DIN HAD SOMEWHAT SUBSIDED  HE WAVED
HIS HAND TO INCLUDE ALL OF THEM  TURNED TO HIS OWN COMRADES  AND SAID 

LISTEN TO THE BELLOWING OF THE WELLFED BEASTS 

PANDEMONIUM BROKE OUT AGAIN  THE SPEAKER RAPPED FOR ORDER AND GLANCED
EXPECTANTLY AT THE OFFICERS IN THE DOORWAYS  THERE WERE CRIES OF
SEDITION AND A GREAT  ROTUND NEW YORK MEMBER BEGAN SHOUTING
ANARCHIST AT ERNEST  AND ERNEST WAS NOT PLEASANT TO LOOK AT  EVERY
FIGHTING FIBRE OF HIM WAS QUIVERING  AND HIS FACE WAS THE FACE OF A
FIGHTING ANIMAL  WITHAL HE WAS COOL AND COLLECTED 

REMEMBER  HE SAID  IN A VOICE THAT MADE ITSELF HEARD ABOVE THE DIN 
THAT AS YOU SHOW MERCY NOW TO THE PROLETARIAT  SOME DAY WILL THAT SAME
PROLETARIAT SHOW MERCY TO YOU 

THE CRIES OF SEDITION AND ANARCHIST REDOUBLED 

I KNOW THAT YOU WILL NOT VOTE FOR THIS BILL  ERNEST WENT ON  YOU HAVE
RECEIVED THE COMMAND FROM YOUR MASTERS TO VOTE AGAINST IT  AND YET YOU
CALL ME ANARCHIST  YOU  WHO HAVE DESTROYED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE 
AND WHO SHAMELESSLY FLAUNT YOUR SCARLET SHAME IN PUBLIC PLACES  CALL ME
ANARCHIST  I DO NOT BELIEVE IN HELLFIRE AND BRIMSTONE BUT IN MOMENTS
LIKE THIS I REGRET MY UNBELIEF  NAY  IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS I ALMOST DO
BELIEVE  SURELY THERE MUST BE A HELL  FOR IN NO LESS PLACE COULD IT BE
POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RECEIVE PUNISHMENT ADEQUATE TO YOUR CRIMES  SO LONG
AS YOU EXIST  THERE IS A VITAL NEED FOR HELLFIRE IN THE COSMOS 

THERE WAS MOVEMENT IN THE DOORWAYS  ERNEST  THE SPEAKER  ALL THE MEMBERS
TURNED TO SEE 

WHY DO YOU NOT CALL YOUR SOLDIERS IN  MR  SPEAKER  AND BID THEM DO
THEIR WORK ERNEST DEMANDED  THEY SHOULD CARRY OUT YOUR PLAN WITH
EXPEDITION 

THERE ARE OTHER PLANS AFOOT  WAS THE RETORT  THAT IS WHY THE SOLDIERS
ARE PRESENT 

OUR PLANS  I SUPPOSE  ERNEST SNEERED  ASSASSINATION OR SOMETHING
KINDRED 

BUT AT THE WORD ASSASSINATION THE UPROAR BROKE OUT AGAIN  ERNEST COULD
NOT MAKE HIMSELF HEARD  BUT HE REMAINED ON HIS FEET WAITING FOR A LULL 
AND THEN IT HAPPENED  FROM MY PLACE IN THE GALLERY I SAW NOTHING EXCEPT
THE FLASH OF THE EXPLOSION  THE ROAR OF IT FILLED MY EARS AND I SAW
ERNEST REELING AND FALLING IN A SWIRL OF SMOKE  AND THE SOLDIERS RUSHING
UP ALL THE AISLES  HIS COMRADES WERE ON THEIR FEET  WILD WITH ANGER 
CAPABLE OF ANY VIOLENCE  BUT ERNEST STEADIED HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT  AND
WAVED HIS ARMS FOR SILENCE 

IT IS A PLOT HIS VOICE RANG OUT IN WARNING TO HIS COMRADES  DO
NOTHING  OR YOU WILL BE DESTROYED 

THEN HE SLOWLY SANK DOWN  AND THE SOLDIERS REACHED HIM  THE NEXT MOMENT
SOLDIERS WERE CLEARING THE GALLERIES AND I SAW NO MORE 

THOUGH HE WAS MY HUSBAND  I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO GET TO HIM  WHEN I
ANNOUNCED WHO I WAS  I WAS PROMPTLY PLACED UNDER ARREST  AND AT THE SAME
TIME WERE ARRESTED ALL SOCIALIST CONGRESSMEN IN WASHINGTON  INCLUDING
THE UNFORTUNATE SIMPSON  WHO LAY ILL WITH TYPHOID FEVER IN HIS HOTEL 

THE TRIAL WAS PROMPT AND BRIEF  THE MEN WERE FOREDOOMED  THE WONDER
WAS THAT ERNEST WAS NOT EXECUTED  THIS WAS A BLUNDER ON THE PART OF
THE OLIGARCHY  AND A COSTLY ONE  BUT THE OLIGARCHY WAS TOO CONFIDENT IN
THOSE DAYS  IT WAS DRUNK WITH SUCCESS  AND LITTLE DID IT DREAM THAT
THAT SMALL HANDFUL OF HEROES HAD WITHIN THEM THE POWER TO ROCK IT TO
ITS FOUNDATIONS  TOMORROW  WHEN THE GREAT REVOLT BREAKS OUT AND ALL
THE WORLD RESOUNDS WITH THE TRAMP  TRAMP OF THE MILLIONS  THE OLIGARCHY 
WILL REALIZE  AND TOO LATE  HOW MIGHTILY THAT BAND OF HEROES HAS GROWN 

      AVIS EVERHARD TOOK FOR GRANTED THAT HER NARRATIVE WOULD BE
     READ IN HER OWN DAY  AND SO OMITS TO MENTION THE OUTCOME OF
     THE TRIAL FOR HIGH TREASON   MANY OTHER SIMILAR
     DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT 
     FIFTYTWO SOCIALIST CONGRESSMEN WERE TRIED  AND ALL WERE
     FOUND GUILTY   STRANGE TO RELATE  NOT ONE RECEIVED THE DEATH
     SENTENCE   EVERHARD AND ELEVEN OTHERS  AMONG WHOM WERE
     THEODORE DONNELSON AND MATTHEW KENT  RECEIVED LIFE
     IMPRISONMENT   THE REMAINING FORTY RECEIVED SENTENCES
     VARYING FROM THIRTY TO FORTYFIVE YEARS WHILE ARTHUR
     SIMPSON  REFERRED TO IN THE MANUSCRIPT AS BEING ILL OF
     TYPHOID FEVER AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION  RECEIVED ONLY
     FIFTEEN YEARS   IT IS THE TRADITION THAT HE DIED OF
     STARVATION IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT  AND THIS HARSH TREATMENT
     IS EXPLAINED AS HAVING BEEN CAUSED BY HIS UNCOMPROMISING
     STUBBORNNESS AND HIS FIERY AND TACTLESS HATRED FOR ALL MEN
     THAT SERVED THE DESPOTISM   HE DIED IN CABANAS IN CUBA 
     WHERE THREE OF HIS COMRADES WERE ALSO CONFINED   THE FIFTY
     TWO SOCIALIST CONGRESSMEN WERE CONFINED IN MILITARY
     FORTRESSES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES   THUS  DU
     BOIS AND WOODS WERE HELD IN PORTO RICO  WHILE EVERHARD AND
     MERRYWEATHER WERE PLACED IN ALCATRAZ  AN ISLAND IN SAN
     FRANCISCO BAY THAT HAD ALREADY SEEN LONG SERVICE AS A
     MILITARY PRISON 

AS A REVOLUTIONIST MYSELF  AS ONE ON THE INSIDE WHO KNEW THE HOPES AND
FEARS AND SECRET PLANS OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS  I AM FITTED TO ANSWER  AS
VERY FEW ARE  THE CHARGE THAT THEY WERE GUILTY OF EXPLODING THE BOMB IN
CONGRESS  AND I CAN SAY FLATLY  WITHOUT QUALIFICATION OR DOUBT OF ANY
SORT  THAT THE SOCIALISTS  IN CONGRESS AND OUT  HAD NO HAND IN THE
AFFAIR  WHO THREW THE BOMB WE DO NOT KNOW  BUT THE ONE THING WE ARE
ABSOLUTELY SURE OF IS THAT WE DID NOT THROW IT 

ON THE OTHER HAND  THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THE IRON HEEL WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACT  OF COURSE  WE CANNOT PROVE THIS  OUR CONCLUSION
IS MERELY PRESUMPTIVE  BUT HERE ARE SUCH FACTS AS WE DO KNOW  IT HAD
BEEN REPORTED TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE  BY SECRETSERVICE AGENTS OF
THE GOVERNMENT  THAT THE SOCIALIST CONGRESSMEN WERE ABOUT TO RESORT TO
TERRORISTIC TACTICS  AND THAT THEY HAD DECIDED UPON THE DAY WHEN
THEIR TACTICS WOULD GO INTO EFFECT  THIS DAY WAS THE VERY DAY OF
THE EXPLOSION  WHEREFORE THE CAPITOL HAD BEEN PACKED WITH TROOPS IN
ANTICIPATION  SINCE WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE BOMB  AND SINCE A BOMB
ACTUALLY WAS EXPLODED  AND SINCE THE AUTHORITIES HAD PREPARED IN ADVANCE
FOR THE EXPLOSION  IT IS ONLY FAIR TO CONCLUDE THAT THE IRON HEEL
DID KNOW  FURTHERMORE  WE CHARGE THAT THE IRON HEEL WAS GUILTY OF THE
OUTRAGE  AND THAT THE IRON HEEL PLANNED AND PERPETRATED THE OUTRAGE FOR
THE PURPOSE OF FOISTING THE GUILT ON OUR SHOULDERS AND SO BRINGING ABOUT
OUR DESTRUCTION 

FROM THE SPEAKER THE WARNING LEAKED OUT TO ALL THE CREATURES IN
THE HOUSE THAT WORE THE SCARLET LIVERY  THEY KNEW  WHILE ERNEST WAS
SPEAKING  THAT SOME VIOLENT ACT WAS TO BE COMMITTED  AND TO DO THEM
JUSTICE  THEY HONESTLY BELIEVED THAT THE ACT WAS TO BE COMMITTED BY
THE SOCIALISTS  AT THE TRIAL  AND STILL WITH HONEST BELIEF  SEVERAL
TESTIFIED TO HAVING SEEN ERNEST PREPARE TO THROW THE BOMB  AND THAT IT
EXPLODED PREMATURELY  OF COURSE THEY SAW NOTHING OF THE SORT  IN THE
FEVERED IMAGINATION OF FEAR THEY THOUGHT THEY SAW  THAT WAS ALL 

AS ERNEST SAID AT THE TRIAL  DOES IT STAND TO REASON  IF I WERE GOING
TO THROW A BOMB  THAT I SHOULD ELECT TO THROW A FEEBLE LITTLE SQUIB LIKE
THE ONE THAT WAS THROWN THERE WASNT ENOUGH POWDER IN IT  IT MADE A LOT
OF SMOKE  BUT HURT NO ONE EXCEPT ME  IT EXPLODED RIGHT AT MY FEET  AND
YET IT DID NOT KILL ME  BELIEVE ME  WHEN I GET TO THROWING BOMBS  ILL
DO DAMAGE  THERELL BE MORE THAN SMOKE IN MY PETARDS 

IN RETURN IT WAS ARGUED BY THE PROSECUTION THAT THE WEAKNESS OF THE
BOMB WAS A BLUNDER ON THE PART OF THE SOCIALISTS  JUST AS ITS PREMATURE
EXPLOSION  CAUSED BY ERNESTS LOSING HIS NERVE AND DROPPING IT  WAS A
BLUNDER  AND TO CLINCH THE ARGUMENT  THERE WERE THE SEVERAL CONGRESSMEN
WHO TESTIFIED TO HAVING SEEN ERNEST FUMBLE AND DROP THE BOMB 

AS FOR OURSELVES  NOT ONE OF US KNEW HOW THE BOMB WAS THROWN  ERNEST
TOLD ME THAT THE FRACTION OF AN INSTANT BEFORE IT EXPLODED HE BOTH HEARD
AND SAW IT STRIKE AT HIS FEET  HE TESTIFIED TO THIS AT THE TRIAL  BUT
NO ONE BELIEVED HIM  BESIDES  THE WHOLE THING  IN POPULAR SLANG  WAS
COOKED UP  THE IRON HEEL HAD MADE UP ITS MIND TO DESTROY US  AND THERE
WAS NO WITHSTANDING IT 

THERE IS A SAYING THAT TRUTH WILL OUT  I HAVE COME TO DOUBT THAT SAYING 
NINETEEN YEARS HAVE ELAPSED  AND DESPITE OUR UNTIRING EFFORTS  WE HAVE
FAILED TO FIND THE MAN WHO REALLY DID THROW THE BOMB  UNDOUBTEDLY HE WAS
SOME EMISSARY OF THE IRON HEEL  BUT HE HAS ESCAPED DETECTION  WE HAVE
NEVER GOT THE SLIGHTEST CLEW TO HIS IDENTITY  AND NOW  AT THIS LATE
DATE  NOTHING REMAINS BUT FOR THE AFFAIR TO TAKE ITS PLACE AMONG THE
MYSTERIES OF HISTORY 

      AVIS EVERHARD WOULD HAVE HAD TO LIVE FOR MANY GENERATIONS
     ERE SHE COULD HAVE SEEN THE CLEARING UP OF THIS PARTICULAR
     MYSTERY   A LITTLE LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO  AND A
     LITTLE MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE DEATH  THE
     CONFESSION OF PERVAISE WAS DISCOVERED IN THE SECRET ARCHIVES
     OF THE VATICAN   IT IS PERHAPS WELL TO TELL A LITTLE
     SOMETHING ABOUT THIS OBSCURE DOCUMENT  WHICH  IN THE MAIN 
     IS OF INTEREST TO THE HISTORIAN ONLY 

     PERVAISE WAS AN AMERICAN  OF FRENCH DESCENT  WHO IN 
     A D   WAS LYING IN THE TOMBS PRISON  NEW YORK CITY  AWAITING
     TRIAL FOR MURDER   FROM HIS CONFESSION WE LEARN THAT HE WAS
     NOT A CRIMINAL  HE WAS WARMBLOODED  PASSIONATE  EMOTIONAL 
     IN AN INSANE FIT OF JEALOUSY HE KILLED HIS WIFEA VERY
     COMMON ACT IN THOSE TIMES  PERVAISE WAS MASTERED BY THE FEAR
     OF DEATH  ALL OF WHICH IS RECOUNTED AT LENGTH IN HIS
     CONFESSION   TO ESCAPE DEATH HE WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING 
     AND THE POLICE AGENTS PREPARED HIM BY ASSURING HIM THAT HE
     COULD NOT POSSIBLY ESCAPE CONVICTION OF MURDER IN THE FIRST
     DEGREE WHEN HIS TRIAL CAME OFF   IN THOSE DAYS  MURDER IN
     THE FIRST DEGREE WAS A CAPITAL OFFENSE   THE GUILTY MAN OR
     WOMAN WAS PLACED IN A SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED DEATHCHAIR 
     AND  UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF COMPETENT PHYSICIANS  WAS
     DESTROYED BY A CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY   THIS WAS CALLED
     ELECTROCUTION  AND IT WAS VERY POPULAR DURING THAT PERIOD 
     ANAESTHESIA  AS A MODE OF COMPULSORY DEATH  WAS NOT
     INTRODUCED UNTIL LATER 

     THIS MAN  GOOD AT HEART BUT WITH A FEROCIOUS ANIMALISM CLOSE
     AT THE SURFACE OF HIS BEING  LYING IN JAIL AND EXPECTANT OF
     NOTHING LESS THAN DEATH  WAS PREVAILED UPON BY THE AGENTS OF
     THE IRON HEEL TO THROW THE BOMB IN THE HOUSE OF
     REPRESENTATIVES   IN HIS CONFESSION HE STATES EXPLICITLY
     THAT HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE BOMB WAS TO BE A FEEBLE THING
     AND THAT NO LIVES WOULD BE LOST   THIS IS DIRECTLY IN LINE
     WITH THE FACT THAT THE BOMB WAS LIGHTLY CHARGED  AND THAT
     ITS EXPLOSION AT EVERHARDS FEET WAS NOT DEADLY 

     PERVAISE WAS SMUGGLED INTO ONE OF THE GALLERIES OSTENSIBLY
     CLOSED FOR REPAIRS   HE WAS TO SELECT THE MOMENT FOR THE
     THROWING OF THE BOMB  AND HE NAIVELY CONFESSES THAT IN HIS
     INTEREST IN EVERHARDS TIRADE AND THE GENERAL COMMOTION
     RAISED THEREBY  HE NEARLY FORGOT HIS MISSION 

     NOT ONLY WAS HE RELEASED FROM PRISON IN REWARD FOR HIS DEED 
     BUT HE WAS GRANTED AN INCOME FOR LIFE   THIS HE DID NOT LONG
     ENJOY   IN  A D   IN SEPTEMBER  HE WAS STRICKEN WITH
     RHEUMATISM OF THE HEART AND LIVED FOR THREE DAYS   IT WAS
     THEN THAT HE SENT FOR THE CATHOLIC PRIEST  FATHER PETER
     DURBAN  AND TO HIM MADE CONFESSION  SO IMPORTANT DID IT SEEM
     TO THE PRIEST  THAT HE HAD THE CONFESSION TAKEN DOWN IN
     WRITING AND SWORN TO   WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THIS WE CAN ONLY
     SURMISE   THE DOCUMENT WAS CERTAINLY IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO
     FIND ITS WAY TO ROME   POWERFUL INFLUENCES MUST HAVE BEEN
     BROUGHT TO BEAR  HENCE ITS SUPPRESSION   FOR CENTURIES NO
     HINT OF ITS EXISTENCE REACHED THE WORLD   IT WAS NOT UNTIL
     IN THE LAST CENTURY THAT LORBIA  THE BRILLIANT ITALIAN
     SCHOLAR  STUMBLED UPON IT QUITE BY CHANCE DURING HIS
     RESEARCHES IN THE VATICAN 

     THERE IS TODAY NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THE IRON HEEL WAS
     RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOMB THAT EXPLODED IN THE HOUSE OF
     REPRESENTATIVES IN  A D   EVEN THOUGH THE PERVAISE
     CONFESSION HAD NEVER COME TO LIGHT  NO REASONABLE DOUBT
     COULD OBTAIN FOR THE ACT IN QUESTION  THAT SENT FIFTYTWO
     CONGRESSMEN TO PRISON  WAS ON A PAR WITH COUNTLESS OTHER
     ACTS COMMITTED BY THE OLIGARCHS  AND  BEFORE THEM  BY THE
     CAPITALISTS 

     THERE IS THE CLASSIC INSTANCE OF THE FEROCIOUS AND WANTON
     JUDICIAL MURDER OF THE INNOCENT AND SOCALLED HAYMARKET
     ANARCHISTS IN CHICAGO IN THE PENULTIMATE DECADE OF THE
     NINETEENTH CENTURY A D  IN A CATEGORY BY ITSELF IS THE
     DELIBERATE BURNING AND DESTRUCTION OF CAPITALIST PROPERTY BY
     THE CAPITALISTS THEMSELVES   FOR SUCH DESTRUCTION OF
     PROPERTY INNOCENT MEN WERE FREQUENTLY PUNISHEDRAILROADED
     IN THE PARLANCE OF THE TIMES 

     IN THE LABOR TROUBLES OF THE FIRST DECADE OF THE TWENTIETH
     CENTURY A D   BETWEEN THE CAPITALISTS AND THE WESTERN
     FEDERATION OF MINERS  SIMILAR BUT MORE BLOODY TACTICS WERE
     EMPLOYED   THE RAILROAD STATION AT INDEPENDENCE WAS BLOWN UP
     BY THE AGENTS OF THE CAPITALISTS   THIRTEEN MEN WERE KILLED 
     AND MANY MORE WERE WOUNDED  AND THEN THE CAPITALISTS 
     CONTROLLING THE LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL MACHINERY OF THE
     STATE OF COLORADO  CHARGED THE MINERS WITH THE CRIME AND
     CAME VERY NEAR TO CONVICTING THEM   ROMAINES  ONE OF THE
     TOOLS IN THIS AFFAIR  LIKE PERVAISE  WAS LYING IN JAIL IN
     ANOTHER STATE  KANSAS  AWAITING TRIAL  WHEN HE WAS
     APPROACHED BY THE AGENTS OF THE CAPITALISTS   BUT  UNLIKE
     PERVAISE THE CONFESSION OF ROMAINES WAS MADE PUBLIC IN HIS
     OWN TIME 

     THEN  DURING THIS SAME PERIOD  THERE WAS THE CASE OF MOYER
     AND HAYWOOD  TWO STRONG  FEARLESS LEADERS OF LABOR   ONE WAS
     PRESIDENT AND THE OTHER WAS SECRETARY OF THE WESTERN
     FEDERATION OF MINERS  THE EXGOVERNOR OF IDAHO HAD BEEN
     MYSTERIOUSLY MURDERED   THE CRIME  AT THE TIME  WAS OPENLY
     CHARGED TO THE MINE OWNERS BY THE SOCIALISTS AND MINERS 
     NEVERTHELESS  IN VIOLATION OF THE NATIONAL AND STATE
     CONSTITUTIONS  AND BY MEANS OF CONSPIRACY ON THE PARTS OF
     THE GOVERNORS OF IDAHO AND COLORADO  MOYER AND HAYWOOD WERE
     KIDNAPPED  THROWN INTO JAIL  AND CHARGED WITH THE MURDER 
     IT WAS THIS INSTANCE THAT PROVOKED FROM EUGENE V  DEBS 
     NATIONAL LEADER OF THE AMERICAN SOCIALISTS AT THE TIME  THE
     FOLLOWING WORDS  THE LABOR LEADERS THAT CANNOT BE BRIBED
     NOR BULLIED  MUST BE AMBUSHED AND MURDERED   THE ONLY CRIME
     OF MOYER AND HAYWOOD IS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN UNSWERVINGLY
     TRUE TO THE WORKING CLASS   THE CAPITALISTS HAVE STOLEN OUR
     COUNTRY  DEBAUCHED OUR POLITICS  DEFILED OUR JUDICIARY  AND
     RIDDEN OVER US ROUGHSHOD  AND NOW THEY PROPOSE TO MURDER
     THOSE WHO WILL NOT ABJECTLY SURRENDER TO THEIR BRUTAL
     DOMINION   THE GOVERNORS OF COLORADO AND IDAHO ARE BUT
     EXECUTING THE MANDATES OF THEIR MASTERS  THE PLUTOCRACY 
     THE ISSUE IS THE WORKERS VERSUS THE PLUTOCRACY   IF THEY
     STRIKE THE FIRST VIOLENT BLOW  WE WILL STRIKE THE LAST 



CHAPTER XVIII

IN THE SHADOW OF SONOMA


OF MYSELF  DURING THIS PERIOD  THERE IS NOT MUCH TO SAY  FOR SIX MONTHS
I WAS KEPT IN PRISON  THOUGH CHARGED WITH NO CRIME  I WAS A SUSPECTA
WORD OF FEAR THAT ALL REVOLUTIONISTS WERE SOON TO COME TO KNOW  BUT
OUR OWN NASCENT SECRET SERVICE WAS BEGINNING TO WORK  BY THE END OF
MY SECOND MONTH IN PRISON  ONE OF THE JAILERS MADE HIMSELF KNOWN AS
A REVOLUTIONIST IN TOUCH WITH THE ORGANIZATION  SEVERAL WEEKS LATER 
JOSEPH PARKHURST  THE PRISON DOCTOR WHO HAD JUST BEEN APPOINTED  PROVED
HIMSELF TO BE A MEMBER OF ONE OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS 

THUS  THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE OLIGARCHY  OUR OWN
ORGANIZATION  WEBLIKE AND SPIDERY  WAS INSINUATING ITSELF  AND SO I
WAS KEPT IN TOUCH WITH ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD WITHOUT  AND
FURTHERMORE  EVERY ONE OF OUR IMPRISONED LEADERS WAS IN CONTACT WITH
BRAVE COMRADES WHO MASQUERADED IN THE LIVERY OF THE IRON HEEL  THOUGH
ERNEST LAY IN PRISON THREE THOUSAND MILES AWAY  ON THE PACIFIC COAST  I
WAS IN UNBROKEN COMMUNICATION WITH HIM  AND OUR LETTERS PASSED REGULARLY
BACK AND FORTH 

THE LEADERS  IN PRISON AND OUT  WERE ABLE TO DISCUSS AND DIRECT THE
CAMPAIGN  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE  WITHIN A FEW MONTHS  TO HAVE
EFFECTED THE ESCAPE OF SOME OF THEM BUT SINCE IMPRISONMENT PROVED
NO BAR TO OUR ACTIVITIES  IT WAS DECIDED TO AVOID ANYTHING PREMATURE 
FIFTYTWO CONGRESSMEN WERE IN PRISON  AND FULLY THREE HUNDRED MORE
OF OUR LEADERS  IT WAS PLANNED THAT THEY SHOULD BE DELIVERED
SIMULTANEOUSLY  IF PART OF THEM ESCAPED  THE VIGILANCE OF THE OLIGARCHS
MIGHT BE AROUSED SO AS TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE OF THE REMAINDER  ON THE
OTHER HAND  IT WAS HELD THAT A SIMULTANEOUS JAILDELIVERY ALL OVER THE
LAND WOULD HAVE IMMENSE PSYCHOLOGICAL INFLUENCE ON THE PROLETARIAT  IT
WOULD SHOW OUR STRENGTH AND GIVE CONFIDENCE 

SO IT WAS ARRANGED  WHEN I WAS RELEASED AT THE END OF SIX MONTHS  THAT
I WAS TO DISAPPEAR AND PREPARE A SECURE HIDINGPLACE FOR ERNEST  TO
DISAPPEAR WAS IN ITSELF NO EASY THING  NO SOONER DID I GET MY FREEDOM
THAN MY FOOTSTEPS BEGAN TO BE DOGGED BY THE SPIES OF THE IRON HEEL 
IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THEY SHOULD BE THROWN OFF THE TRACK  AND THAT
I SHOULD WIN TO CALIFORNIA  IT IS LAUGHABLE  THE WAY THIS WAS
ACCOMPLISHED 

ALREADY THE PASSPORT SYSTEM  MODELLED ON THE RUSSIAN  WAS DEVELOPING  I
DARED NOT CROSS THE CONTINENT IN MY OWN CHARACTER  IT WAS NECESSARY THAT
I SHOULD BE COMPLETELY LOST IF EVER I WAS TO SEE ERNEST AGAIN  FOR BY
TRAILING ME AFTER HE ESCAPED  HE WOULD BE CAUGHT ONCE MORE  AGAIN  I
COULD NOT DISGUISE MYSELF AS A PROLETARIAN AND TRAVEL  THERE REMAINED
THE DISGUISE OF A MEMBER OF THE OLIGARCHY  WHILE THE ARCHOLIGARCHS WERE
NO MORE THAN A HANDFUL  THERE WERE MYRIADS OF LESSER ONES OF THE TYPE 
SAY  OF MR  WICKSONMEN  WORTH A FEW MILLIONS  WHO WERE ADHERENTS OF
THE ARCHOLIGARCHS  THE WIVES AND DAUGHTERS OF THESE LESSER OLIGARCHS
WERE LEGION  AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT I SHOULD ASSUME THE DISGUISE OF
SUCH A ONE  A FEW YEARS LATER THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE  BECAUSE
THE PASSPORT SYSTEM WAS TO BECOME SO PERFECT THAT NO MAN  WOMAN  NOR
CHILD IN ALL THE LAND WAS UNREGISTERED AND UNACCOUNTED FOR IN HIS OR HER
MOVEMENTS 

WHEN THE TIME WAS RIPE  THE SPIES WERE THROWN OFF MY TRACK  AN HOUR
LATER AVIS EVERHARD WAS NO MORE  AT THAT TIME ONE FELICE VAN VERDIGHAN 
ACCOMPANIED BY TWO MAIDS AND A LAPDOG  WITH ANOTHER MAID FOR THE
LAPDOG  ENTERED A DRAWINGROOM ON A PULLMAN  AND A FEW MINUTES LATER
WAS SPEEDING WEST 

      THIS RIDICULOUS PICTURE WELL ILLUSTRATES THE HEARTLESS
     CONDUCT OF THE MASTERS   WHILE PEOPLE STARVED  LAPDOGS WERE
     WAITED UPON BY MAIDS   THIS WAS A SERIOUS MASQUERADE ON THE
     PART OF AVIS EVERHARD  LIFE AND DEATH AND THE CAUSE WERE IN
     THE ISSUE THEREFORE THE PICTURE MUST BE ACCEPTED AS A TRUE
     PICTURE   IT AFFORDS A STRIKING COMMENTARY OF THE TIMES 

      PULLMANTHE DESIGNATION OF THE MORE LUXURIOUS RAILWAY
     CARS OF THE PERIOD AND SO NAMED FROM THE INVENTOR 

THE THREE MAIDS WHO ACCOMPANIED ME WERE REVOLUTIONISTS  TWO WERE MEMBERS
OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS  AND THE THIRD  GRACE HOLBROOK  ENTERED A GROUP
THE FOLLOWING YEAR  AND SIX MONTHS LATER WAS EXECUTED BY THE IRON HEEL 
SHE IT WAS WHO WAITED UPON THE DOG  OF THE OTHER TWO  BERTHA STOLE
DISAPPEARED TWELVE YEARS LATER  WHILE ANNA ROYLSTON STILL LIVES AND
PLAYS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT PART IN THE REVOLUTION 

      DESPITE CONTINUAL AND ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE HAZARDS  ANNA
     ROYLSTON LIVED TO THE ROYAL AGE OF NINETYONE   AS THE
     POCOCKS DEFIED THE EXECUTIONERS OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS  SO
     SHE DEFIED THE EXECUTIONERS OF THE IRON HEEL   SHE BORE A
     CHARMED LIFE AND PROSPERED AMID DANGERS AND ALARMS   SHE
     HERSELF WAS AN EXECUTIONER FOR THE FIGHTING GROUPS  AND 
     KNOWN AS THE RED VIRGIN  SHE BECAME ONE OF THE INSPIRED
     FIGURES OF THE REVOLUTION   WHEN SHE WAS AN OLD WOMAN OF
     SIXTYNINE SHE SHOT BLOODY HALCLIFFE DOWN IN THE MIDST OF
     HIS ARMED ESCORT AND GOT AWAY UNSCATHED   IN THE END SHE
     DIED PEACEABLY OF OLD AGE IN A SECRET REFUGE OF THE
     REVOLUTIONISTS IN THE OZARK MOUNTAINS 

WITHOUT ADVENTURE WE CROSSED THE UNITED STATES TO CALIFORNIA  WHEN THE
TRAIN STOPPED AT SIXTEENTH STREET STATION  IN OAKLAND  WE ALIGHTED  AND
THERE FELICE VAN VERDIGHAN  WITH HER TWO MAIDS  HER LAPDOG  AND
HER LAPDOGS MAID  DISAPPEARED FOREVER  THE MAIDS  GUIDED BY TRUSTY
COMRADES  WERE LED AWAY  OTHER COMRADES TOOK CHARGE OF ME  WITHIN HALF
AN HOUR AFTER LEAVING THE TRAIN I WAS ON BOARD A SMALL FISHING BOAT
AND OUT ON THE WATERS OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY  THE WINDS BAFFLED  AND WE
DRIFTED AIMLESSLY THE GREATER PART OF THE NIGHT  BUT I SAW THE LIGHTS OF
ALCATRAZ WHERE ERNEST LAY  AND FOUND COMFORT IN THE THOUGHT OF NEARNESS
TO HIM  BY DAWN  WHAT WITH THE ROWING OF THE FISHERMEN  WE MADE THE
MARIN ISLANDS  HERE WE LAY IN HIDING ALL DAY  AND ON THE FOLLOWING
NIGHT  SWEPT ON BY A FLOOD TIDE AND A FRESH WIND  WE CROSSED SAN PABLO
BAY IN TWO HOURS AND RAN UP PETALUMA CREEK 

HERE HORSES WERE READY AND ANOTHER COMRADE  AND WITHOUT DELAY WE WERE
AWAY THROUGH THE STARLIGHT  TO THE NORTH I COULD SEE THE LOOM OF SONOMA
MOUNTAIN  TOWARD WHICH WE RODE  WE LEFT THE OLD TOWN OF SONOMA TO THE
RIGHT AND RODE UP A CANYON THAT LAY BETWEEN OUTLYING BUTTRESSES OF THE
MOUNTAIN  THE WAGONROAD BECAME A WOODROAD  THE WOODROAD BECAME A
COWPATH  AND THE COWPATH DWINDLED AWAY AND CEASED AMONG THE UPLAND
PASTURES  STRAIGHT OVER SONOMA MOUNTAIN WE RODE  IT WAS THE SAFEST
ROUTE  THERE WAS NO ONE TO MARK OUR PASSING 

DAWN CAUGHT US ON THE NORTHERN BROW  AND IN THE GRAY LIGHT WE DROPPED
DOWN THROUGH CHAPARRAL INTO REDWOOD CANYONS DEEP AND WARM WITH THE
BREATH OF PASSING SUMMER  IT WAS OLD COUNTRY TO ME THAT I KNEW AND
LOVED  AND SOON I BECAME THE GUIDE  THE HIDINGPLACE WAS MINE  I HAD
SELECTED IT  WE LET DOWN THE BARS AND CROSSED AN UPLAND MEADOW  NEXT  WE
WENT OVER A LOW  OAKCOVERED RIDGE AND DESCENDED INTO A SMALLER MEADOW 
AGAIN WE CLIMBED A RIDGE  THIS TIME RIDING UNDER REDLIMBED MADRONOS AND
MANZANITAS OF DEEPER RED  THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN STREAMED UPON
OUR BACKS AS WE CLIMBED  A FLIGHT OF QUAIL THRUMMED OFF THROUGH THE
THICKETS  A BIG JACKRABBIT CROSSED OUR PATH  LEAPING SWIFTLY AND
SILENTLY LIKE A DEER  AND THEN A DEER  A MANYPRONGED BUCK  THE SUN
FLASHING REDGOLD FROM NECK AND SHOULDERS  CLEARED THE CREST OF THE
RIDGE BEFORE US AND WAS GONE 

WE FOLLOWED IN HIS WAKE A SPACE  THEN DROPPED DOWN A ZIGZAG TRAIL THAT
HE DISDAINED INTO A GROUP OF NOBLE REDWOODS THAT STOOD ABOUT A POOL OF
WATER MURKY WITH MINERALS FROM THE MOUNTAIN SIDE  I KNEW EVERY INCH OF
THE WAY  ONCE A WRITER FRIEND OF MINE HAD OWNED THE RANCH BUT HE  TOO 
HAD BECOME A REVOLUTIONIST  THOUGH MORE DISASTROUSLY THAN I  FOR HE WAS
ALREADY DEAD AND GONE  AND NONE KNEW WHERE NOR HOW  HE ALONE  IN THE
DAYS HE HAD LIVED  KNEW THE SECRET OF THE HIDINGPLACE FOR WHICH I WAS
BOUND  HE HAD BOUGHT THE RANCH FOR BEAUTY  AND PAID A ROUND PRICE FOR
IT  MUCH TO THE DISGUST OF THE LOCAL FARMERS  HE USED TO TELL WITH GREAT
GLEE HOW THEY WERE WONT TO SHAKE THEIR HEADS MOURNFULLY AT THE PRICE  TO
ACCOMPLISH PONDEROUSLY A BIT OF MENTAL ARITHMETIC  AND THEN TO SAY  BUT
YOU CANT MAKE SIX PER CENT ON IT 

BUT HE WAS DEAD NOW  NOR DID THE RANCH DESCEND TO HIS CHILDREN  OF ALL
MEN  IT WAS NOW THE PROPERTY OF MR  WICKSON  WHO OWNED THE WHOLE EASTERN
AND NORTHERN SLOPES OF SONOMA MOUNTAIN  RUNNING FROM THE SPRECKELS
ESTATE TO THE DIVIDE OF BENNETT VALLEY  OUT OF IT HE HAD MADE A
MAGNIFICENT DEERPARK  WHERE  OVER THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF SWEET SLOPES
AND GLADES AND CANYONS  THE DEER RAN ALMOST IN PRIMITIVE WILDNESS  THE
PEOPLE WHO HAD OWNED THE SOIL HAD BEEN DRIVEN AWAY  A STATE HOME FOR THE
FEEBLEMINDED HAD ALSO BEEN DEMOLISHED TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE DEER 

TO CAP IT ALL  WICKSONS HUNTING LODGE WAS A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM MY
HIDINGPLACE  THIS  INSTEAD OF BEING A DANGER  WAS AN ADDED SECURITY 
WE WERE SHELTERED UNDER THE VERY AEGIS OF ONE OF THE MINOR OLIGARCHS 
SUSPICION  BY THE NATURE OF THE SITUATION  WAS TURNED ASIDE  THE LAST
PLACE IN THE WORLD THE SPIES OF THE IRON HEEL WOULD DREAM OF LOOKING FOR
ME  AND FOR ERNEST WHEN HE JOINED ME  WAS WICKSONS DEERPARK 

WE TIED OUR HORSES AMONG THE REDWOODS AT THE POOL  FROM A CACHE BEHIND
A HOLLOW ROTTING LOG MY COMPANION BROUGHT OUT A VARIETY OF THINGS A
FIFTYPOUND SACK OF FLOUR  TINNED FOODS OF ALL SORTS  COOKING UTENSILS 
BLANKETS  A CANVAS TARPAULIN  BOOKS AND WRITING MATERIAL  A GREAT BUNDLE
OF LETTERS  A FIVEGALLON CAN OF KEROSENE  AN OIL STOVE  AND  LAST AND
MOST IMPORTANT  A LARGE COIL OF STOUT ROPE  SO LARGE WAS THE SUPPLY OF
THINGS THAT A NUMBER OF TRIPS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO CARRY THEM TO THE
REFUGE 

BUT THE REFUGE WAS VERY NEAR  TAKING THE ROPE AND LEADING THE WAY  I
PASSED THROUGH A GLADE OF TANGLED VINES AND BUSHES THAT RAN BETWEEN TWO
WOODED KNOLLS  THE GLADE ENDED ABRUPTLY AT THE STEEP BANK OF A STREAM 
IT WAS A LITTLE STREAM  RISING FROM SPRINGS  AND THE HOTTEST SUMMER
NEVER DRIED IT UP  ON EVERY HAND WERE TALL WOODED KNOLLS  A GROUP OF
THEM  WITH ALL THE SEEMING OF HAVING BEEN FLUNG THERE FROM SOME CARELESS
TITANS HAND  THERE WAS NO BEDROCK IN THEM  THEY ROSE FROM THEIR BASES
HUNDREDS OF FEET  AND THEY WERE COMPOSED OF RED VOLCANIC EARTH  THE
FAMOUS WINESOIL OF SONOMA  THROUGH THESE THE TINY STREAM HAD CUT ITS
DEEP AND PRECIPITOUS CHANNEL 

IT WAS QUITE A SCRAMBLE DOWN TO THE STREAM BED  AND  ONCE ON THE BED 
WE WENT DOWN STREAM PERHAPS FOR A HUNDRED FEET  AND THEN WE CAME TO THE
GREAT HOLE  THERE WAS NO WARNING OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE HOLE  NOR
WAS IT A HOLE IN THE COMMON SENSE OF THE WORD  ONE CRAWLED THROUGH
TIGHTLOCKED BRIERS AND BRANCHES  AND FOUND ONESELF ON THE VERY EDGE 
PEERING OUT AND DOWN THROUGH A GREEN SCREEN  A COUPLE OF HUNDRED FEET IN
LENGTH AND WIDTH  IT WAS HALF OF THAT IN DEPTH  POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF
SOME FAULT THAT HAD OCCURRED WHEN THE KNOLLS WERE FLUNG TOGETHER  AND
CERTAINLY HELPED BY FREAKISH EROSION  THE HOLE HAD BEEN SCOOPED OUT IN
THE COURSE OF CENTURIES BY THE WASH OF WATER  NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH
APPEAR  ALL WAS GARMENTED BY VEGETATION  FROM TINY MAIDENHAIR AND
GOLDBACK FERNS TO MIGHTY REDWOOD AND DOUGLAS SPRUCES  THESE GREAT TREES
EVEN SPRANG OUT FROM THE WALLS OF THE HOLE  SOME LEANED OVER AT ANGLES
AS GREAT AS FORTYFIVE DEGREES  THOUGH THE MAJORITY TOWERED STRAIGHT UP
FROM THE SOFT AND ALMOST PERPENDICULAR EARTH WALLS 

IT WAS A PERFECT HIDINGPLACE  NO ONE EVER CAME THERE  NOT EVEN THE
VILLAGE BOYS OF GLEN ELLEN  HAD THIS HOLE EXISTED IN THE BED OF A CANYON
A MILE LONG  OR SEVERAL MILES LONG  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL KNOWN  BUT
THIS WAS NO CANYON  FROM BEGINNING TO END THE LENGTH OF THE STREAM WAS
NO MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED YARDS  THREE HUNDRED YARDS ABOVE THE HOLE THE
STREAM TOOK ITS RISE IN A SPRING AT THE FOOT OF A FLAT MEADOW  A HUNDRED
YARDS BELOW THE HOLE THE STREAM RAN OUT INTO OPEN COUNTRY  JOINING THE
MAIN STREAM AND FLOWING ACROSS ROLLING AND GRASSCOVERED LAND 

MY COMPANION TOOK A TURN OF THE ROPE AROUND A TREE  AND WITH ME FAST ON
THE OTHER END LOWERED AWAY  IN NO TIME I WAS ON THE BOTTOM  AND IN BUT
A SHORT WHILE HE HAD CARRIED ALL THE ARTICLES FROM THE CACHE AND LOWERED
THEM DOWN TO ME  HE HAULED THE ROPE UP AND HID IT  AND BEFORE HE WENT
AWAY CALLED DOWN TO ME A CHEERFUL PARTING 

BEFORE I GO ON I WANT TO SAY A WORD FOR THIS COMRADE  JOHN CARLSON  A
HUMBLE FIGURE OF THE REVOLUTION  ONE OF THE COUNTLESS FAITHFUL ONES IN
THE RANKS  HE WORKED FOR WICKSON  IN THE STABLES NEAR THE HUNTING LODGE 
IN FACT  IT WAS ON WICKSONS HORSES THAT WE HAD RIDDEN OVER SONOMA
MOUNTAIN  FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS NOW JOHN CARLSON HAS BEEN CUSTODIAN
OF THE REFUGE  NO THOUGHT OF DISLOYALTY  I AM SURE  HAS EVER ENTERED HIS
MIND DURING ALL THAT TIME  TO BETRAY HIS TRUST WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HIS
MIND A THING UNDREAMED  HE WAS PHLEGMATIC  STOLID TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT
ONE COULD NOT BUT WONDER HOW THE REVOLUTION HAD ANY MEANING TO HIM AT
ALL  AND YET LOVE OF FREEDOM GLOWED SOMBRELY AND STEADILY IN HIS
DIM SOUL  IN WAYS IT WAS INDEED GOOD THAT HE WAS NOT FLIGHTY AND
IMAGINATIVE  HE NEVER LOST HIS HEAD  HE COULD OBEY ORDERS  AND HE WAS
NEITHER CURIOUS NOR GARRULOUS  ONCE I ASKED HOW IT WAS THAT HE WAS A
REVOLUTIONIST 

WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I WAS A SOLDIER  WAS HIS ANSWER  IT WAS IN
GERMANY  THERE ALL YOUNG MEN MUST BE IN THE ARMY  SO I WAS IN THE ARMY 
THERE WAS ANOTHER SOLDIER THERE  A YOUNG MAN  TOO  HIS FATHER WAS WHAT
YOU CALL AN AGITATOR  AND HIS FATHER WAS IN JAIL FOR LESE MAJESTYWHAT
YOU CALL SPEAKING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE EMPEROR  AND THE YOUNG MAN  THE
SON  TALKED WITH ME MUCH ABOUT PEOPLE  AND WORK  AND THE ROBBERY OF
THE PEOPLE BY THE CAPITALISTS  HE MADE ME SEE THINGS IN NEW WAYS  AND
I BECAME A SOCIALIST  HIS TALK WAS VERY TRUE AND GOOD  AND I HAVE NEVER
FORGOTTEN  WHEN I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES I HUNTED UP THE SOCIALISTS 
I BECAME A MEMBER OF A SECTIONTHAT WAS IN THE DAY OF THE S  L  P 
THEN LATER  WHEN THE SPLIT CAME  I JOINED THE LOCAL OF THE S  P  I WAS
WORKING IN A LIVERY STABLE IN SAN FRANCISCO THEN  THAT WAS BEFORE THE
EARTHQUAKE  I HAVE PAID MY DUES FOR TWENTYTWO YEARS  I AM YET A MEMBER 
AND I YET PAY MY DUES  THOUGH IT IS VERY SECRET NOW  I WILL ALWAYS PAY
MY DUES  AND WHEN THE COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH COMES  I WILL BE GLAD 

LEFT TO MYSELF  I PROCEEDED TO COOK BREAKFAST ON THE OIL STOVE AND TO
PREPARE MY HOME  OFTEN  IN THE EARLY MORNING  OR IN THE EVENING AFTER
DARK  CARLSON WOULD STEAL DOWN TO THE REFUGE AND WORK FOR A COUPLE OF
HOURS  AT FIRST MY HOME WAS THE TARPAULIN  LATER  A SMALL TENT WAS PUT
UP  AND STILL LATER  WHEN WE BECAME ASSURED OF THE PERFECT SECURITY OF
THE PLACE  A SMALL HOUSE WAS ERECTED  THIS HOUSE WAS COMPLETELY HIDDEN
FROM ANY CHANCE EYE THAT MIGHT PEER DOWN FROM THE EDGE OF THE HOLE  THE
LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD  ALSO  THE
HOUSE WAS BUILT AGAINST THE PERPENDICULAR WALL AND IN THE WALL ITSELF 
SHORED BY STRONG TIMBERS  WELL DRAINED AND VENTILATED  WE EXCAVATED TWO
SMALL ROOMS  OH  BELIEVE ME  WE HAD MANY COMFORTS  WHEN BIEDENBACH 
THE GERMAN TERRORIST  HID WITH US SOME TIME LATER  HE INSTALLED A
SMOKECONSUMING DEVICE THAT ENABLED US TO SIT BY CRACKLING WOOD FIRES ON
WINTER NIGHTS 

AND HERE I MUST SAY A WORD FOR THAT GENTLESOULED TERRORIST  THAN WHOM
THERE IS NO COMRADE IN THE REVOLUTION MORE FEARFULLY MISUNDERSTOOD 
COMRADE BIEDENBACH DID NOT BETRAY THE CAUSE  NOR WAS HE EXECUTED BY
THE COMRADES AS IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED  THIS CANARD WAS CIRCULATED BY
THE CREATURES OF THE OLIGARCHY  COMRADE BIEDENBACH WAS ABSENTMINDED 
FORGETFUL  HE WAS SHOT BY ONE OF OUR LOOKOUTS AT THE CAVEREFUGE AT
CARMEL  THROUGH FAILURE ON HIS PART TO REMEMBER THE SECRET SIGNALS  IT
WAS ALL A SAD MISTAKE  AND THAT HE BETRAYED HIS FIGHTING GROUP IS AN
ABSOLUTE LIE  NO TRUER  MORE LOYAL MAN EVER LABORED FOR THE CAUSE 

      SEARCH AS WE MAY THROUGH ALL THE MATERIAL OF THOSE TIMES
     THAT HAS COME DOWN TO US  WE CAN FIND NO CLEW TO THE
     BIEDENBACH HERE REFERRED TO   NO MENTION IS MADE OF HIM
     ANYWHERE SAVE IN THE EVERHARD MANUSCRIPT 
     

     FOR NINETEEN YEARS NOW THE REFUGE THAT I SELECTED HAD BEEN ALMOST
     CONTINUOUSLY OCCUPIED  AND IN ALL THAT TIME  WITH ONE EXCEPTION  IT
     HAS NEVER BEEN DISCOVERED BY AN OUTSIDER   AND YET IT WAS ONLY A
     QUARTER OF A MILE FROM WICKSONS HUNTINGLODGE  AND A SHORT MILE
     FROM THE VILLAGE OF GLEN ELLEN   I WAS ABLE  ALWAYS  TO HEAR THE
     MORNING AND EVENING TRAINS ARRIVE AND DEPART  AND I USED TO SET MY
     WATCH BY THE WHISTLE AT THE BRICKYARDS 

      IF THE CURIOUS TRAVELLER WILL TURN SOUTH FROM GLEN ELLEN 
     HE WILL FIND HIMSELF ON A BOULEVARD THAT IS IDENTICAL WITH
     THE OLD COUNTRY ROAD SEVEN CENTURIES AGO   A QUARTER OF A
     MILE FROM GLEN ELLEN  AFTER THE SECOND BRIDGE IS PASSED  TO
     THE RIGHT WILL BE NOTICED A BARRANCA THAT RUNS LIKE A SCAR
     ACROSS THE ROLLING LAND TOWARD A GROUP OF WOODED KNOLLS 
     THE BARRANCA IS THE SITE OF THE ANCIENT RIGHT OF WAY THAT IN
     THE TIME OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IN LAND RAN ACROSS THE HOLDING
     OF ONE CHAUVET  A FRENCH PIONEER OF CALIFORNIA WHO CAME FROM
     HIS NATIVE COUNTRY IN THE FABLED DAYS OF GOLD   THE WOODED
     KNOLLS ARE THE SAME KNOLLS REFERRED TO BY AVIS EVERHARD 

     THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE OF  A D  BROKE OFF THE SIDE OF ONE
     OF THESE KNOLLS AND TOPPLED IT INTO THE HOLE WHERE THE
     EVERHARDS MADE THEIR REFUGE   SINCE THE FINDING OF THE
     MANUSCRIPT EXCAVATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE  AND THE HOUSE  THE
     TWO CAVE ROOMS  AND ALL THE ACCUMULATED RUBBISH OF LONG
     OCCUPANCY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT  MANY VALUABLE RELICS
     HAVE BEEN FOUND  AMONG WHICH  CURIOUS TO RELATE  IS THE
     SMOKECONSUMING DEVICE OF BIEDENBACHS MENTIONED IN THE
     NARRATIVE   STUDENTS INTERESTED IN SUCH MATTERS SHOULD READ
     THE BROCHURE OF ARNOLD BENTHAM SOON TO BE PUBLISHED 

     A MILE NORTHWEST FROM THE WOODED KNOLLS BRINGS ONE TO THE
     SITE OF WAKE ROBIN LODGE AT THE JUNCTION OF WILDWATER AND
     SONOMA CREEKS  IT MAY BE NOTICED  IN PASSING  THAT WILD
     WATER WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED GRAHAM CREEK AND WAS SO NAMED ON
     THE EARLY LOCAL MAPS   BUT THE LATER NAME STICKS   IT WAS AT
     WAKE ROBIN LODGE THAT AVIS EVERHARD LATER LIVED FOR SHORT
     PERIODS  WHEN  DISGUISED AS AN AGENTPROVOCATEUR OF THE IRON
     HEEL  SHE WAS ENABLED TO PLAY WITH IMPUNITY HER PART AMONG
     MEN AND EVENTS   THE OFFICIAL PERMISSION TO OCCUPY WAKE
     ROBIN LODGE IS STILL ON THE RECORDS  SIGNED BY NO LESS A MAN
     THAN WICKSON  THE MINOR OLIGARCH OF THE MANUSCRIPT 


CHAPTER XIX

TRANSFORMATION


YOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF OVER AGAIN  ERNEST WROTE TO ME  YOU MUST CEASE
TO BE  YOU MUST BECOME ANOTHER WOMANAND NOT MERELY IN THE CLOTHES YOU
WEAR  BUT INSIDE YOUR SKIN UNDER THE CLOTHES  YOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF
OVER AGAIN SO THAT EVEN I WOULD NOT KNOW YOUYOUR VOICE  YOUR GESTURES 
YOUR MANNERISMS  YOUR CARRIAGE  YOUR WALK  EVERYTHING 

THIS COMMAND I OBEYED  EVERY DAY I PRACTISED FOR HOURS IN BURYING
FOREVER THE OLD AVIS EVERHARD BENEATH THE SKIN OF ANOTHER WOMAN WHOM I
MAY CALL MY OTHER SELF  IT WAS ONLY BY LONG PRACTICE THAT SUCH RESULTS
COULD BE OBTAINED  IN THE MERE DETAIL OF VOICE INTONATION I PRACTISED
ALMOST PERPETUALLY TILL THE VOICE OF MY NEW SELF BECAME FIXED 
AUTOMATIC  IT WAS THIS AUTOMATIC ASSUMPTION OF A ROLE THAT WAS
CONSIDERED IMPERATIVE  ONE MUST BECOME SO ADEPT AS TO DECEIVE ONESELF 
IT WAS LIKE LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE  SAY THE FRENCH  AT FIRST SPEECH IN
FRENCH IS SELFCONSCIOUS  A MATTER OF THE WILL  THE STUDENT THINKS
IN ENGLISH AND THEN TRANSMUTES INTO FRENCH  OR READS IN FRENCH BUT
TRANSMUTES INTO ENGLISH BEFORE HE CAN UNDERSTAND  THEN LATER  BECOMING
FIRMLY GROUNDED  AUTOMATIC  THE STUDENT READS  WRITES  AND THINKS IN
FRENCH  WITHOUT ANY RECOURSE TO ENGLISH AT ALL 

AND SO WITH OUR DISGUISES  IT WAS NECESSARY FOR US TO PRACTISE UNTIL OUR
ASSUMED ROLES BECAME REAL UNTIL TO BE OUR ORIGINAL SELVES WOULD REQUIRE
A WATCHFUL AND STRONG EXERCISE OF WILL  OF COURSE  AT FIRST  MUCH WAS
MERE BLUNDERING EXPERIMENT  WE WERE CREATING A NEW ART  AND WE HAD MUCH
TO DISCOVER  BUT THE WORK WAS GOING ON EVERYWHERE MASTERS IN THE
ART WERE DEVELOPING  AND A FUND OF TRICKS AND EXPEDIENTS WAS BEING
ACCUMULATED  THIS FUND BECAME A SORT OF TEXTBOOK THAT WAS PASSED ON  A
PART OF THE CURRICULUM  AS IT WERE  OF THE SCHOOL OF REVOLUTION 

      DISGUISE DID BECOME A VERITABLE ART DURING THAT PERIOD 
     THE REVOLUTIONISTS MAINTAINED SCHOOLS OF ACTING IN ALL THEIR
     REFUGES  THEY SCORNED ACCESSORIES  SUCH AS WIGS AND BEARDS 
     FALSE EYEBROWS  AND SUCH AIDS OF THE THEATRICAL ACTORS   THE
     GAME OF REVOLUTION WAS A GAME OF LIFE AND DEATH  AND MERE
     ACCESSORIES WERE TRAPS  DISGUISE HAD TO BE FUNDAMENTAL 
     INTRINSIC  PART AND PARCEL OF ONES BEING  SECOND NATURE 
     THE RED VIRGIN IS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MOST
     ADEPT IN THE ART  TO WHICH MUST BE ASCRIBED HER LONG AND
     SUCCESSFUL CAREER 

IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT MY FATHER DISAPPEARED  HIS LETTERS  WHICH HAD
COME TO ME REGULARLY  CEASED  HE NO LONGER APPEARED AT OUR PELL STREET
QUARTERS  OUR COMRADES SOUGHT HIM EVERYWHERE  THROUGH OUR SECRET SERVICE
WE RANSACKED EVERY PRISON IN THE LAND  BUT HE WAS LOST AS COMPLETELY AS
IF THE EARTH HAD SWALLOWED HIM UP  AND TO THIS DAY NO CLEW TO HIS END
HAS BEEN DISCOVERED 

      DISAPPEARANCE WAS ONE OF THE HORRORS OF THE TIME   AS A
     MOTIF  IN SONG AND STORY  IT CONSTANTLY CROPS UP   IT WAS AN
     INEVITABLE CONCOMITANT OF THE SUBTERRANEAN WARFARE THAT
     RAGED THROUGH THOSE THREE CENTURIES   THIS PHENOMENON WAS
     ALMOST AS COMMON IN THE OLIGARCH CLASS AND THE LABOR CASTES 
     AS IT WAS IN THE RANKS OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS   WITHOUT
     WARNING  WITHOUT TRACE  MEN AND WOMEN  AND EVEN CHILDREN 
     DISAPPEARED AND WERE SEEN NO MORE  THEIR END SHROUDED IN
     MYSTERY 

SIX LONELY MONTHS I SPENT IN THE REFUGE  BUT THEY WERE NOT IDLE MONTHS 
OUR ORGANIZATION WENT ON APACE  AND THERE WERE MOUNTAINS OF WORK ALWAYS
WAITING TO BE DONE  ERNEST AND HIS FELLOWLEADERS  FROM THEIR PRISONS 
DECIDED WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AND IT REMAINED FOR US ON THE OUTSIDE TO
DO IT  THERE WAS THE ORGANIZATION OF THE MOUTHTOMOUTH PROPAGANDA
THE ORGANIZATION  WITH ALL ITS RAMIFICATIONS  OF OUR SPY SYSTEM THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR SECRET PRINTINGPRESSES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
OUR UNDERGROUND RAILWAYS  WHICH MEANT THE KNITTING TOGETHER OF ALL OUR
MYRIADS OF PLACES OF REFUGE  AND THE FORMATION OF NEW REFUGES WHERE
LINKS WERE MISSING IN THE CHAINS WE RAN OVER ALL THE LAND 

SO I SAY  THE WORK WAS NEVER DONE  AT THE END OF SIX MONTHS MY
LONELINESS WAS BROKEN BY THE ARRIVAL OF TWO COMRADES  THEY WERE YOUNG
GIRLS  BRAVE SOULS AND PASSIONATE LOVERS OF LIBERTY  LORA PETERSON  WHO
DISAPPEARED IN   AND KATE BIERCE  WHO LATER MARRIED DU BOIS  AND
WHO IS STILL WITH US WITH EYES LIFTED TO TOMORROWS SUN  THAT HERALDS
IN THE NEW AGE 

      DU BOIS  THE PRESENT LIBRARIAN OF ARDIS  IS A LINEAL
     DESCENDANT OF THIS REVOLUTIONARY PAIR 

THE TWO GIRLS ARRIVED IN A FLURRY OF EXCITEMENT  DANGER  AND SUDDEN
DEATH  IN THE CREW OF THE FISHING BOAT THAT CONVEYED THEM ACROSS SAN
PABLO BAY WAS A SPY  A CREATURE OF THE IRON HEEL  HE HAD SUCCESSFULLY
MASQUERADED AS A REVOLUTIONIST AND PENETRATED DEEP INTO THE SECRETS
OF OUR ORGANIZATION  WITHOUT DOUBT HE WAS ON MY TRAIL  FOR WE HAD LONG
SINCE LEARNED THAT MY DISAPPEARANCE HAD BEEN CAUSE OF DEEP CONCERN TO
THE SECRET SERVICE OF THE OLIGARCHY  LUCKILY  AS THE OUTCOME PROVED  HE
HAD NOT DIVULGED HIS DISCOVERIES TO ANY ONE  HE HAD EVIDENTLY DELAYED
REPORTING  PREFERRING TO WAIT UNTIL HE HAD BROUGHT THINGS TO A
SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION BY DISCOVERING MY HIDINGPLACE AND CAPTURING ME 
HIS INFORMATION DIED WITH HIM  UNDER SOME PRETEXT  AFTER THE GIRLS HAD
LANDED AT PETALUMA CREEK AND TAKEN TO THE HORSES  HE MANAGED TO GET AWAY
FROM THE BOAT 

PART WAY UP SONOMA MOUNTAIN  JOHN CARLSON LET THE GIRLS GO ON  LEADING
HIS HORSE  WHILE HE WENT BACK ON FOOT  HIS SUSPICIONS HAD BEEN AROUSED 
HE CAPTURED THE SPY  AND AS TO WHAT THEN HAPPENED  CARLSON GAVE US A
FAIR IDEA 

I FIXED HIM  WAS CARLSONS UNIMAGINATIVE WAY OF DESCRIBING THE AFFAIR 
I FIXED HIM  HE REPEATED  WHILE A SOMBRE LIGHT BURNT IN HIS EYES  AND
HIS HUGE  TOILDISTORTED HANDS OPENED AND CLOSED ELOQUENTLY  HE MADE NO
NOISE  I HID HIM  AND TONIGHT I WILL GO BACK AND BURY HIM DEEP 

DURING THAT PERIOD I USED TO MARVEL AT MY OWN METAMORPHOSIS  AT TIMES IT
SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE  EITHER THAT I HAD EVER LIVED A PLACID  PEACEFUL LIFE
IN A COLLEGE TOWN  OR ELSE THAT I HAD BECOME A REVOLUTIONIST INURED TO
SCENES OF VIOLENCE AND DEATH  ONE OR THE OTHER COULD NOT BE  ONE WAS
REAL  THE OTHER WAS A DREAM  BUT WHICH WAS WHICH WAS THIS PRESENT
LIFE OF A REVOLUTIONIST  HIDING IN A HOLE  A NIGHTMARE OR WAS I A
REVOLUTIONIST WHO HAD SOMEWHERE  SOMEHOW  DREAMED THAT IN SOME FORMER
EXISTENCE I HAVE LIVED IN BERKELEY AND NEVER KNOWN OF LIFE MORE VIOLENT
THAN TEAS AND DANCES  DEBATING SOCIETIES  AND LECTURES ROOMS BUT THEN I
SUPPOSE THIS WAS A COMMON EXPERIENCE OF ALL OF US WHO HAD RALLIED UNDER
THE RED BANNER OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN 

I OFTEN REMEMBERED FIGURES FROM THAT OTHER LIFE  AND  CURIOUSLY ENOUGH 
THEY APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED  NOW AND AGAIN  IN MY NEW LIFE  THERE WAS
BISHOP MOREHOUSE  IN VAIN WE SEARCHED FOR HIM AFTER OUR ORGANIZATION HAD
DEVELOPED  HE HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM ASYLUM TO ASYLUM  WE TRACED HIM
FROM THE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE AT NAPA TO THE ONE IN STOCKTON 
AND FROM THERE TO THE ONE IN THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY CALLED AGNEWS  AND
THERE THE TRAIL CEASED  THERE WAS NO RECORD OF HIS DEATH  IN SOME WAY HE
MUST HAVE ESCAPED  LITTLE DID I DREAM OF THE AWFUL MANNER IN WHICH I
WAS TO SEE HIM ONCE AGAINTHE FLEETING GLIMPSE OF HIM IN THE WHIRLWIND
CARNAGE OF THE CHICAGO COMMUNE 

JACKSON  WHO HAD LOST HIS ARM IN THE SIERRA MILLS AND WHO HAD BEEN THE
CAUSE OF MY OWN CONVERSION INTO A REVOLUTIONIST  I NEVER SAW AGAIN
BUT WE ALL KNEW WHAT HE DID BEFORE HE DIED  HE NEVER JOINED THE
REVOLUTIONISTS  EMBITTERED BY HIS FATE  BROODING OVER HIS WRONGS  HE
BECAME AN ANARCHISTNOT A PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHIST  BUT A MERE ANIMAL  MAD
WITH HATE AND LUST FOR REVENGE  AND WELL HE REVENGED HIMSELF  EVADING
THE GUARDS  IN THE NIGHTTIME WHILE ALL WERE ASLEEP  HE BLEW THE
PERTONWAITHE PALACE INTO ATOMS  NOT A SOUL ESCAPED  NOT EVEN THE GUARDS 
AND IN PRISON  WHILE AWAITING TRIAL  HE SUFFOCATED HIMSELF UNDER HIS
BLANKETS 

DR  HAMMERFIELD AND DR  BALLINGFORD ACHIEVED QUITE DIFFERENT FATES FROM
THAT OF JACKSON  THEY HAVE BEEN FAITHFUL TO THEIR SALT  AND THEY HAVE
BEEN CORRESPONDINGLY REWARDED WITH ECCLESIASTICAL PALACES WHEREIN THEY
DWELL AT PEACE WITH THE WORLD  BOTH ARE APOLOGISTS FOR THE OLIGARCHY 
BOTH HAVE GROWN VERY FAT  DR  HAMMERFIELD  AS ERNEST ONCE SAID  HAS
SUCCEEDED IN MODIFYING HIS METAPHYSICS SO AS TO GIVE GODS SANCTION TO
THE IRON HEEL  AND ALSO TO INCLUDE MUCH WORSHIP OF BEAUTY AND TO REDUCE
TO AN INVISIBLE WRAITH THE GASEOUS VERTEBRATE DESCRIBED BY HAECKELTHE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DR  HAMMERFIELD AND DR  BALLINGFORD BEING THAT THE
LATTER HAS MADE THE GOD OF THE OLIGARCHS A LITTLE MORE GASEOUS AND A
LITTLE LESS VERTEBRATE 

PETER DONNELLY  THE SCAB FOREMAN AT THE SIERRA MILLS WHOM I ENCOUNTERED
WHILE INVESTIGATING THE CASE OF JACKSON  WAS A SURPRISE TO ALL OF US  IN
 I WAS PRESENT AT A MEETING OF THE FRISCO REDS  OF ALL OUR FIGHTING
GROUPS THIS ONE WAS THE MOST FORMIDABLE  FEROCIOUS  AND MERCILESS  IT
WAS REALLY NOT A PART OF OUR ORGANIZATION  ITS MEMBERS WERE FANATICS 
MADMEN  WE DARED NOT ENCOURAGE SUCH A SPIRIT  ON THE OTHER HAND  THOUGH
THEY DID NOT BELONG TO US  WE REMAINED ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THEM  IT
WAS A MATTER OF VITAL IMPORTANCE THAT BROUGHT ME THERE THAT NIGHT  I 
ALONE IN THE MIDST OF A SCORE OF MEN  WAS THE ONLY PERSON UNMASKED 
AFTER THE BUSINESS THAT BROUGHT ME THERE WAS TRANSACTED  I WAS LED
AWAY BY ONE OF THEM  IN A DARK PASSAGE THIS GUIDE STRUCK A MATCH  AND 
HOLDING IT CLOSE TO HIS FACE  SLIPPED BACK HIS MASK  FOR A MOMENT I
GAZED UPON THE PASSIONWROUGHT FEATURES OF PETER DONNELLY  THEN THE
MATCH WENT OUT 

I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW IT WAS ME  HE SAID IN THE DARKNESS  DYOU
REMEMBER DALLAS  THE SUPERINTENDENT

I NODDED AT RECOLLECTION OF THE VULPINEFACE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE
SIERRA MILLS 

WELL  I GOT HIM FIRST  DONNELLY SAID WITH PRIDE  TWAS AFTER THAT I
JOINED THE REDS 

BUT HOW COMES IT THAT YOU ARE HERE I QUERIED  YOUR WIFE AND
CHILDREN

DEAD  HE ANSWERED  THATS WHY  NO  HE WENT ON HASTILY  TIS NOT
REVENGE FOR THEM  THEY DIED EASILY IN THEIR BEDSSICKNESS  YOU SEE 
ONE TIME AND ANOTHER  THEY TIED MY ARMS WHILE THEY LIVED  AND NOW THAT
THEYRE GONE  TIS REVENGE FOR MY BLASTED MANHOOD IM AFTER  I WAS
ONCE PETER DONNELLY  THE SCAB FOREMAN  BUT TONIGHT IM NUMBER  OF THE
FRISCO REDS  COME ON NOW  AND ILL GET YOU OUT OF THIS 

MORE I HEARD OF HIM AFTERWARD  IN HIS OWN WAY HE HAD TOLD THE TRUTH
WHEN HE SAID ALL WERE DEAD  BUT ONE LIVED  TIMOTHY  AND HIM HIS FATHER
CONSIDERED DEAD BECAUSE HE HAD TAKEN SERVICE WITH THE IRON HEEL IN THE
MERCENARIES  A MEMBER OF THE FRISCO REDS PLEDGED HIMSELF TO TWELVE
ANNUAL EXECUTIONS  THE PENALTY FOR FAILURE WAS DEATH  A MEMBER WHO
FAILED TO COMPLETE HIS NUMBER COMMITTED SUICIDE  THESE EXECUTIONS WERE
NOT HAPHAZARD  THIS GROUP OF MADMEN MET FREQUENTLY AND PASSED WHOLESALE
JUDGMENTS UPON OFFENDING MEMBERS AND SERVITORS OF THE OLIGARCHY  THE
EXECUTIONS WERE AFTERWARD APPORTIONED BY LOT 

      IN ADDITION TO THE LABOR CASTES  THERE AROSE ANOTHER
     CASTE  THE MILITARY   A STANDING ARMY OF PROFESSIONAL
     SOLDIERS WAS CREATED  OFFICERED BY MEMBERS OF THE OLIGARCHY
     AND KNOWN AS THE MERCENARIES  THIS INSTITUTION TOOK THE
     PLACE OF THE MILITIA  WHICH HAD PROVED IMPRACTICABLE UNDER
     THE NEW REGIME   OUTSIDE THE REGULAR SECRET SERVICE OF THE
     IRON HEEL  THERE WAS FURTHER ESTABLISHED A SECRET SERVICE OF
     THE MERCENARIES  THIS LATTER FORMING A CONNECTING LINK
     BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE MILITARY 

IN FACT  THE BUSINESS THAT BROUGHT ME THERE THE NIGHT OF MY VISIT WAS
SUCH A TRIAL  ONE OF OUR OWN COMRADES  WHO FOR YEARS HAD SUCCESSFULLY
MAINTAINED HIMSELF IN A CLERICAL POSITION IN THE LOCAL BUREAU OF THE
SECRET SERVICE OF THE IRON HEEL  HAD FALLEN UNDER THE BAN OF THE FRISCO
REDS AND WAS BEING TRIED  OF COURSE HE WAS NOT PRESENT  AND OF COURSE
HIS JUDGES DID NOT KNOW THAT HE WAS ONE OF OUR MEN  MY MISSION HAD BEEN
TO TESTIFY TO HIS IDENTITY AND LOYALTY  IT MAY BE WONDERED HOW WE CAME
TO KNOW OF THE AFFAIR AT ALL  THE EXPLANATION IS SIMPLE  ONE OF OUR
SECRET AGENTS WAS A MEMBER OF THE FRISCO REDS  IT WAS NECESSARY FOR US
TO KEEP AN EYE ON FRIEND AS WELL AS FOE  AND THIS GROUP OF MADMEN WAS
NOT TOO UNIMPORTANT TO ESCAPE OUR SURVEILLANCE 

BUT TO RETURN TO PETER DONNELLY AND HIS SON  ALL WENT WELL WITH DONNELLY
UNTIL  IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR  HE FOUND AMONG THE SHEAF OF EXECUTIONS
THAT FELL TO HIM THE NAME OF TIMOTHY DONNELLY  THEN IT WAS THAT THAT
CLANNISHNESS  WHICH WAS HIS TO SO EXTRAORDINARY A DEGREE  ASSERTED
ITSELF  TO SAVE HIS SON  HE BETRAYED HIS COMRADES  IN THIS HE WAS
PARTIALLY BLOCKED  BUT A DOZEN OF THE FRISCO REDS WERE EXECUTED  AND
THE GROUP WAS WELLNIGH DESTROYED  IN RETALIATION  THE SURVIVORS METED
OUT TO DONNELLY THE DEATH HE HAD EARNED BY HIS TREASON 

NOR DID TIMOTHY DONNELLY LONG SURVIVE  THE FRISCO REDS PLEDGED
THEMSELVES TO HIS EXECUTION  EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE BY THE OLIGARCHY TO
SAVE HIM  HE WAS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE PART OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER 
THREE OF THE REDS LOST THEIR LIVES IN VAIN EFFORTS TO GET HIM  THE GROUP
WAS COMPOSED ONLY OF MEN  IN THE END THEY FELL BACK ON A WOMAN  ONE
OF OUR COMRADES  AND NONE OTHER THAN ANNA ROYLSTON  OUR INNER
CIRCLE FORBADE HER  BUT SHE HAD EVER A WILL OF HER OWN AND DISDAINED
DISCIPLINE  FURTHERMORE  SHE WAS A GENIUS AND LOVABLE  AND WE COULD
NEVER DISCIPLINE HER ANYWAY  SHE IS IN A CLASS BY HERSELF AND NOT
AMENABLE TO THE ORDINARY STANDARDS OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS 

DESPITE OUR REFUSAL TO GRANT PERMISSION TO DO THE DEED  SHE WENT ON WITH
IT  NOW ANNA ROYLSTON WAS A FASCINATING WOMAN  ALL SHE HAD TO DO WAS
TO BECKON A MAN TO HER  SHE BROKE THE HEARTS OF SCORES OF OUR YOUNG
COMRADES  AND SCORES OF OTHERS SHE CAPTURED  AND BY THEIR HEARTSTRINGS
LED INTO OUR ORGANIZATION  YET SHE STEADFASTLY REFUSED TO MARRY  SHE
DEARLY LOVED CHILDREN  BUT SHE HELD THAT A CHILD OF HER OWN WOULD CLAIM
HER FROM THE CAUSE  AND THAT IT WAS THE CAUSE TO WHICH HER LIFE WAS
DEVOTED 

IT WAS AN EASY TASK FOR ANNA ROYLSTON TO WIN TIMOTHY DONNELLY  HER
CONSCIENCE DID NOT TROUBLE HER  FOR AT THAT VERY TIME OCCURRED THE
NASHVILLE MASSACRE  WHEN THE MERCENARIES  DONNELLY IN COMMAND  LITERALLY
MURDERED EIGHT HUNDRED WEAVERS OF THAT CITY  BUT SHE DID NOT KILL
DONNELLY  SHE TURNED HIM OVER  A PRISONER  TO THE FRISCO REDS 
THIS HAPPENED ONLY LAST YEAR  AND NOW SHE HAD BEEN RENAMED  THE
REVOLUTIONISTS EVERYWHERE ARE CALLING HER THE RED VIRGIN 

      IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE SECOND REVOLT WAS CRUSHED  THAT THE
     FRISCO REDS FLOURISHED AGAIN   AND FOR TWO GENERATIONS THE
     GROUP FLOURISHED   THEN AN AGENT OF THE IRON HEEL MANAGED TO
     BECOME A MEMBER  PENETRATED ALL ITS SECRETS  AND BROUGHT
     ABOUT ITS TOTAL ANNIHILATION   THIS OCCURRED IN  A D 
     THE MEMBERS WERE EXECUTED ONE AT A TIME  AT INTERVALS OF
     THREE WEEKS  AND THEIR BODIES EXPOSED IN THE LABORGHETTO OF
     SAN FRANCISCO 

COLONEL INGRAM AND COLONEL VAN GILBERT ARE TWO MORE FAMILIAR FIGURES
THAT I WAS LATER TO ENCOUNTER  COLONEL INGRAM ROSE HIGH IN THE OLIGARCHY
AND BECAME MINISTER TO GERMANY  HE WAS CORDIALLY DETESTED BY THE
PROLETARIAT OF BOTH COUNTRIES  IT WAS IN BERLIN THAT I MET HIM  WHERE 
AS AN ACCREDITED INTERNATIONAL SPY OF THE IRON HEEL  I WAS RECEIVED BY
HIM AND AFFORDED MUCH ASSISTANCE  INCIDENTALLY  I MAY STATE THAT IN MY
DUAL ROLE I MANAGED A FEW IMPORTANT THINGS FOR THE REVOLUTION 

COLONEL VAN GILBERT BECAME KNOWN AS SNARLING VAN GILBERT  HIS
IMPORTANT PART WAS PLAYED IN DRAFTING THE NEW CODE AFTER THE CHICAGO
COMMUNE  BUT BEFORE THAT  AS TRIAL JUDGE  HE HAD EARNED SENTENCE OF
DEATH BY HIS FIENDISH MALIGNANCY  I WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT TRIED HIM AND
PASSED SENTENCE UPON HIM  ANNA ROYLSTON CARRIED OUT THE EXECUTION 

STILL ANOTHER FIGURE ARISES OUT OF THE OLD LIFEJACKSONS LAWYER  LEAST
OF ALL WOULD I HAVE EXPECTED AGAIN TO MEET THIS MAN  JOSEPH HURD  IT WAS
A STRANGE MEETING  LATE AT NIGHT  TWO YEARS AFTER THE CHICAGO COMMUNE 
ERNEST AND I ARRIVED TOGETHER AT THE BENTON HARBOR REFUGE  THIS WAS
IN MICHIGAN  ACROSS THE LAKE FROM CHICAGO  WE ARRIVED JUST AT THE
CONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL OF A SPY  SENTENCE OF DEATH HAD BEEN PASSED  AND
HE WAS BEING LED AWAY  SUCH WAS THE SCENE AS WE CAME UPON IT  THE NEXT
MOMENT THE WRETCHED MAN HAD WRENCHED FREE FROM HIS CAPTORS AND FLUNG
HIMSELF AT MY FEET  HIS ARMS CLUTCHING ME ABOUT THE KNEES IN A VICELIKE
GRIP AS HE PRAYED IN A FRENZY FOR MERCY  AS HE TURNED HIS AGONIZED FACE
UP TO ME  I RECOGNIZED HIM AS JOSEPH HURD  OF ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS
I HAVE WITNESSED  NEVER HAVE I BEEN SO UNNERVED AS BY THIS FRANTIC
CREATURES PLEADING FOR LIFE  HE WAS MAD FOR LIFE  IT WAS PITIABLE  HE
REFUSED TO LET GO OF ME  DESPITE THE HANDS OF A DOZEN COMRADES  AND WHEN
AT LAST HE WAS DRAGGED SHRIEKING AWAY  I SANK DOWN FAINTING UPON THE
FLOOR  IT IS FAR EASIER TO SEE BRAVE MEN DIE THAN TO HEAR A COWARD BEG
FOR LIFE 

      THE BENTON HARBOR REFUGE WAS A CATACOMB  THE ENTRANCE OF
     WHICH WAS CUNNINGLY CONTRIVED BY WAY OF A WELL   IT HAS BEEN
     MAINTAINED IN A FAIR STATE OF PRESERVATION  AND THE CURIOUS
     VISITOR MAY TODAY TREAD ITS LABYRINTHS TO THE ASSEMBLY
     HALL  WHERE  WITHOUT DOUBT  OCCURRED THE SCENE DESCRIBED BY
     AVIS EVERHARD   FARTHER ON ARE THE CELLS WHERE THE PRISONERS
     WERE CONFINED  AND THE DEATH CHAMBER WHERE THE EXECUTIONS
     TOOK PLACE   BEYOND IS THE CEMETERYLONG  WINDING GALLERIES
     HEWN OUT OF THE SOLID ROCK  WITH RECESSES ON EITHER HAND 
     WHEREIN  TIER ABOVE TIER  LIE THE REVOLUTIONISTS JUST AS
     THEY WERE LAID AWAY BY THEIR COMRADES LONG YEARS AGONE 



CHAPTER XX

A LOST OLIGARCH


BUT IN REMEMBERING THE OLD LIFE I HAVE RUN AHEAD OF MY STORY INTO THE
NEW LIFE  THE WHOLESALE JAIL DELIVERY DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL WELL ALONG
INTO   COMPLICATED AS IT WAS  IT WAS CARRIED THROUGH WITHOUT A
HITCH  AND AS A VERY CREDITABLE ACHIEVEMENT IT CHEERED US ON IN OUR
WORK  FROM CUBA TO CALIFORNIA  OUT OF SCORES OF JAILS  MILITARY PRISONS 
AND FORTRESSES  IN A SINGLE NIGHT  WE DELIVERED FIFTYONE OF OUR
FIFTYTWO CONGRESSMEN  AND IN ADDITION OVER THREE HUNDRED OTHER LEADERS 
THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE INSTANCE OF MISCARRIAGE  NOT ONLY DID THEY
ESCAPE  BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM WON TO THE REFUGES AS PLANNED  THE ONE
COMRADE CONGRESSMAN WE DID NOT GET WAS ARTHUR SIMPSON  AND HE HAD
ALREADY DIED IN CABANAS AFTER CRUEL TORTURES 

THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED WAS PERHAPS THE HAPPIEST OF MY LIFE
WITH ERNEST  DURING THAT TIME WE WERE NEVER APART  LATER  WHEN WE WENT
BACK INTO THE WORLD  WE WERE SEPARATED MUCH  NOT MORE IMPATIENTLY DO I
AWAIT THE FLAME OF TOMORROWS REVOLT THAN DID I THAT NIGHT AWAIT THE
COMING OF ERNEST  I HAD NOT SEEN HIM FOR SO LONG  AND THE THOUGHT OF A
POSSIBLE HITCH OR ERROR IN OUR PLANS THAT WOULD KEEP HIM STILL IN HIS
ISLAND PRISON ALMOST DROVE ME MAD  THE HOURS PASSED LIKE AGES  I WAS
ALL ALONE  BIEDENBACH  AND THREE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN THE
REFUGE  WERE OUT AND OVER THE MOUNTAIN  HEAVILY ARMED AND PREPARED FOR
ANYTHING  THE REFUGES ALL OVER THE LAND WERE QUITE EMPTY  I IMAGINE  OF
COMRADES THAT NIGHT 

JUST AS THE SKY PALED WITH THE FIRST WARNING OF DAWN  I HEARD THE
SIGNAL FROM ABOVE AND GAVE THE ANSWER  IN THE DARKNESS I ALMOST EMBRACED
BIEDENBACH  WHO CAME DOWN FIRST BUT THE NEXT MOMENT I WAS IN ERNESTS
ARMS  AND IN THAT MOMENT  SO COMPLETE HAD BEEN MY TRANSFORMATION  I
DISCOVERED IT WAS ONLY BY AN EFFORT OF WILL THAT I COULD BE THE OLD AVIS
EVERHARD  WITH THE OLD MANNERISMS AND SMILES  PHRASES AND INTONATIONS OF
VOICE  IT WAS BY STRONG EFFORT ONLY THAT I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN MY
OLD IDENTITY I COULD NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO FORGET FOR AN INSTANT  SO
AUTOMATICALLY IMPERATIVE HAD BECOME THE NEW PERSONALITY I HAD CREATED 

ONCE INSIDE THE LITTLE CABIN  I SAW ERNESTS FACE IN THE LIGHT  WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF THE PRISON PALLOR  THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN HIMAT LEAST 
NOT MUCH  HE WAS MY SAME LOVERHUSBAND AND HERO  AND YET THERE WAS A
CERTAIN ASCETIC LENGTHENING OF THE LINES OF HIS FACE  BUT HE COULD WELL
STAND IT  FOR IT SEEMED TO ADD A CERTAIN NOBILITY OF REFINEMENT TO THE
RIOTOUS EXCESS OF LIFE THAT HAD ALWAYS MARKED HIS FEATURES  HE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN A TRIFLE GRAVER THAN OF YORE  BUT THE GLINT OF LAUGHTER STILL
WAS IN HIS EYES  HE WAS TWENTY POUNDS LIGHTER  BUT IN SPLENDID
PHYSICAL CONDITION  HE HAD KEPT UP EXERCISE DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF
CONFINEMENT  AND HIS MUSCLES WERE LIKE IRON  IN TRUTH  HE WAS IN BETTER
CONDITION THAN WHEN HE HAD ENTERED PRISON  HOURS PASSED BEFORE HIS HEAD
TOUCHED PILLOW AND I HAD SOOTHED HIM OFF TO SLEEP  BUT THERE WAS NO
SLEEP FOR ME  I WAS TOO HAPPY  AND THE FATIGUE OF JAILBREAKING AND
RIDING HORSEBACK HAD NOT BEEN MINE 

WHILE ERNEST SLEPT  I CHANGED MY DRESS  ARRANGED MY HAIR DIFFERENTLY 
AND CAME BACK TO MY NEW AUTOMATIC SELF  THEN  WHEN BIEDENBACH AND THE
OTHER COMRADES AWOKE  WITH THEIR AID I CONCOCTED A LITTLE CONSPIRACY 
ALL WAS READY  AND WE WERE IN THE CAVEROOM THAT SERVED FOR KITCHEN
AND DINING ROOM WHEN ERNEST OPENED THE DOOR AND ENTERED  AT THAT MOMENT
BIEDENBACH ADDRESSED ME AS MARY  AND I TURNED AND ANSWERED HIM  THEN I
GLANCED AT ERNEST WITH CURIOUS INTEREST  SUCH AS ANY YOUNG COMRADE MIGHT
BETRAY ON SEEING FOR THE FIRST TIME SO NOTED A HERO OF THE REVOLUTION 
BUT ERNESTS GLANCE TOOK ME IN AND QUESTIONED IMPATIENTLY PAST AND
AROUND THE ROOM  THE NEXT MOMENT I WAS BEING INTRODUCED TO HIM AS MARY
HOLMES 

TO COMPLETE THE DECEPTION  AN EXTRA PLATE WAS LAID  AND WHEN WE SAT DOWN
TO TABLE ONE CHAIR WAS NOT OCCUPIED  I COULD HAVE CRIED WITH JOY AS I
NOTED ERNESTS INCREASING UNEASINESS AND IMPATIENCE  FINALLY HE COULD
STAND IT NO LONGER 

WHERES MY WIFE HE DEMANDED BLUNTLY 

SHE IS STILL ASLEEP  I ANSWERED 

IT WAS THE CRUCIAL MOMENT  BUT MY VOICE WAS A STRANGE VOICE  AND IN IT
HE RECOGNIZED NOTHING FAMILIAR  THE MEAL WENT ON  I TALKED A GREAT
DEAL  AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY  AS A HEROWORSHIPPER MIGHT TALK  AND IT
WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE WAS MY HERO  I ROSE TO A CLIMAX OF ENTHUSIASM AND
WORSHIP  AND  BEFORE HE COULD GUESS MY INTENTION  THREW MY ARMS AROUND
HIS NECK AND KISSED HIM ON THE LIPS  HE HELD ME FROM HIM AT ARMS LENGTH
AND STARED ABOUT IN ANNOYANCE AND PERPLEXITY  THE FOUR MEN GREETED HIM
WITH ROARS OF LAUGHTER  AND EXPLANATIONS WERE MADE  AT FIRST HE WAS
SCEPTICAL  HE SCRUTINIZED ME KEENLY AND WAS HALF CONVINCED  THEN SHOOK
HIS HEAD AND WOULD NOT BELIEVE  IT WAS NOT UNTIL I BECAME THE OLD AVIS
EVERHARD AND WHISPERED SECRETS IN HIS EAR THAT NONE KNEW BUT HE AND AVIS
EVERHARD  THAT HE ACCEPTED ME AS HIS REALLY  TRULY WIFE 

IT WAS LATER IN THE DAY THAT HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS  MANIFESTING GREAT
EMBARRASSMENT AND CLAIMING POLYGAMOUS EMOTIONS 

YOU ARE MY AVIS  HE SAID  AND YOU ARE ALSO SOME ONE ELSE  YOU ARE TWO
WOMEN  AND THEREFORE YOU ARE MY HAREM  AT ANY RATE  WE ARE SAFE NOW 
IF THE UNITED STATES BECOMES TOO HOT FOR US  WHY I HAVE QUALIFIED FOR
CITIZENSHIP IN TURKEY 

      AT THAT TIME POLYGAMY WAS STILL PRACTISED IN TURKEY 

LIFE BECAME FOR ME VERY HAPPY IN THE REFUGE  IT IS TRUE  WE WORKED
HARD AND FOR LONG HOURS BUT WE WORKED TOGETHER  WE HAD EACH OTHER FOR
EIGHTEEN PRECIOUS MONTHS  AND WE WERE NOT LONELY  FOR THERE WAS ALWAYS
A COMING AND GOING OF LEADERS AND COMRADESSTRANGE VOICES FROM THE
UNDERWORLD OF INTRIGUE AND REVOLUTION  BRINGING STRANGER TALES OF
STRIFE AND WAR FROM ALL OUR BATTLELINE  AND THERE WAS MUCH FUN AND
DELIGHT  WE WERE NOT MERE GLOOMY CONSPIRATORS  WE TOILED HARD AND
SUFFERED GREATLY  FILLED THE GAPS IN OUR RANKS AND WENT ON  AND THROUGH
ALL THE LABOUR AND THE PLAY AND INTERPLAY OF LIFE AND DEATH WE FOUND
TIME TO LAUGH AND LOVE  THERE WERE ARTISTS  SCIENTISTS  SCHOLARS 
MUSICIANS  AND POETS AMONG US AND IN THAT HOLE IN THE GROUND CULTURE
WAS HIGHER AND FINER THAN IN THE PALACES OF WONDERCITIES OF THE
OLIGARCHS  IN TRUTH  MANY OF OUR COMRADES TOILED AT MAKING BEAUTIFUL
THOSE SAME PALACES AND WONDERCITIES 

      THIS IS NOT BRAGGADOCIO ON THE PART OF AVIS EVERHARD   THE
     FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE
     REVOLUTIONISTS   WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW OF THE
     MUSICIANS AND SINGERS  AND OF A FEW OF THE OLIGARCHS  ALL
     THE GREAT CREATORS OF THE PERIOD WHOSE NAMES HAVE COME DOWN
     TO US  WERE REVOLUTIONISTS 

NOR WERE WE CONFINED TO THE REFUGE ITSELF  OFTEN AT NIGHT WE RODE OVER
THE MOUNTAINS FOR EXERCISE  AND WE RODE ON WICKSONS HORSES  IF ONLY HE
KNEW HOW MANY REVOLUTIONISTS HIS HORSES HAVE CARRIED WE EVEN WENT ON
PICNICS TO ISOLATED SPOTS WE KNEW  WHERE WE REMAINED ALL DAY  GOING
BEFORE DAYLIGHT AND RETURNING AFTER DARK  ALSO  WE USED WICKSONS CREAM
AND BUTTER  AND ERNEST WAS NOT ABOVE SHOOTING WICKSONS QUAIL AND
RABBITS  AND  ON OCCASION  HIS YOUNG BUCKS 

      EVEN AS LATE AS THAT PERIOD  CREAM AND BUTTER WERE STILL
     CRUDELY EXTRACTED FROM COWS MILK   THE LABORATORY
     PREPARATION OF FOODS HAD NOT YET BEGUN 

INDEED  IT WAS A SAFE REFUGE  I HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS DISCOVERED ONLY
ONCE  AND THIS BRINGS ME TO THE CLEARING UP OF THE MYSTERY OF THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF YOUNG WICKSON  NOW THAT HE IS DEAD  I AM FREE TO SPEAK 
THERE WAS A NOOK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT HOLE WHERE THE SUN SHONE FOR
SEVERAL HOURS AND WHICH WAS HIDDEN FROM ABOVE  HERE WE HAD CARRIED
MANY LOADS OF GRAVEL FROM THE CREEKBED  SO THAT IT WAS DRY AND WARM 
A PLEASANT BASKING PLACE AND HERE  ONE AFTERNOON  I WAS DROWSING  HALF
ASLEEP  OVER A VOLUME OF MENDENHALL  I WAS SO COMFORTABLE AND SECURE
THAT EVEN HIS FLAMING LYRICS FAILED TO STIR ME 

      IN ALL THE EXTANT LITERATURE AND DOCUMENTS OF THAT PERIOD 
     CONTINUAL REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE POEMS OF RUDOLPH
     MENDENHALL   BY HIS COMRADES HE WAS CALLED THE FLAME   HE
     WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A GREAT GENIUS YET  BEYOND WEIRD AND
     HAUNTING FRAGMENTS OF HIS VERSE  QUOTED IN THE WRITINGS OF
     OTHERS  NOTHING OF HIS HAS COME DOWN TO US   HE WAS EXECUTED
     BY THE IRON HEEL IN  A D 

I WAS AROUSED BY A CLOD OF EARTH STRIKING AT MY FEET  THEN FROM ABOVE 
I HEARD A SOUND OF SCRAMBLING  THE NEXT MOMENT A YOUNG MAN  WITH A
FINAL SLIDE DOWN THE CRUMBLING WALL  ALIGHTED AT MY FEET  IT WAS PHILIP
WICKSON  THOUGH I DID NOT KNOW HIM AT THE TIME  HE LOOKED AT ME COOLLY
AND UTTERED A LOW WHISTLE OF SURPRISE 

WELL  HE SAID AND THE NEXT MOMENT  CAP IN HAND  HE WAS SAYING  I BEG
YOUR PARDON  I DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND ANY ONE HERE 

I WAS NOT SO COOL  I WAS STILL A TYRO SO FAR AS CONCERNED KNOWING HOW TO
BEHAVE IN DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES  LATER ON  WHEN I WAS AN INTERNATIONAL
SPY  I SHOULD HAVE BEEN LESS CLUMSY  I AM SURE  AS IT WAS  I SCRAMBLED
TO MY FEET AND CRIED OUT THE DANGER CALL 

WHY DID YOU DO THAT HE ASKED  LOOKING AT ME SEARCHINGLY 

IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD NO SUSPICION OF OUR PRESENCE WHEN MAKING THE
DESCENT  I RECOGNIZED THIS WITH RELIEF 

FOR WHAT PURPOSE DO YOU THINK I DID IT I COUNTERED  I WAS INDEED
CLUMSY IN THOSE DAYS 

I DONT KNOW  HE ANSWERED  SHAKING HIS HEAD  UNLESS YOUVE GOT
FRIENDS ABOUT  ANYWAY  YOUVE GOT SOME EXPLANATIONS TO MAKE  I DONT
LIKE THE LOOK OF IT  YOU ARE TRESPASSING  THIS IS MY FATHERS LAND 
AND

BUT AT THAT MOMENT  BIEDENBACH  EVERY POLITE AND GENTLE  SAID FROM
BEHIND HIM IN A LOW VOICE  HANDS UP  MY YOUNG SIR 

YOUNG WICKSON PUT HIS HANDS UP FIRST  THEN TURNED TO CONFRONT
BIEDENBACH  WHO HELD A THIRTYTHIRTY AUTOMATIC RIFLE ON HIM  WICKSON WAS
IMPERTURBABLE 

OH  HO  HE SAID  A NEST OF REVOLUTIONISTSAND QUITE A HORNETS NEST
IT WOULD SEEM  WELL  YOU WONT ABIDE HERE LONG  I CAN TELL YOU 

MAYBE YOULL ABIDE HERE LONG ENOUGH TO RECONSIDER THAT STATEMENT 
BIEDENBACH SAID QUIETLY  AND IN THE MEANWHILE I MUST ASK YOU TO COME
INSIDE WITH ME 

INSIDE THE YOUNG MAN WAS GENUINELY ASTONISHED  HAVE YOU A CATACOMB
HERE I HAVE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS 

COME AND SEE  BIEDENBACH ANSWERED WITH HIS ADORABLE ACCENT 

BUT IT IS UNLAWFUL  WAS THE PROTEST 

YES  BY YOUR LAW  THE TERRORIST REPLIED SIGNIFICANTLY  BUT BY OUR
LAW  BELIEVE ME  IT IS QUITE LAWFUL  YOU MUST ACCUSTOM YOURSELF TO
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE IN ANOTHER WORLD THAN THE ONE OF OPPRESSION AND
BRUTALITY IN WHICH YOU HAVE LIVED 

THERE IS ROOM FOR ARGUMENT THERE  WICKSON MUTTERED 

THEN STAY WITH US AND DISCUSS IT 

THE YOUNG FELLOW LAUGHED AND FOLLOWED HIS CAPTOR INTO THE HOUSE  HE
WAS LED INTO THE INNER CAVEROOM  AND ONE OF THE YOUNG COMRADES LEFT TO
GUARD HIM  WHILE WE DISCUSSED THE SITUATION IN THE KITCHEN 

BIEDENBACH  WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES  HELD THAT WICKSON MUST DIE  AND WAS
QUITE RELIEVED WHEN WE OUTVOTED HIM AND HIS HORRIBLE PROPOSITION  ON THE
OTHER HAND  WE COULD NOT DREAM OF ALLOWING THE YOUNG OLIGARCH TO DEPART 

ILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO  ERNEST SAID  WELL KEEP HIM AND GIVE HIM AN
EDUCATION 

I BESPEAK THE PRIVILEGE  THEN  OF ENLIGHTENING HIM IN JURISPRUDENCE 
BIEDENBACH CRIED 

AND SO A DECISION WAS LAUGHINGLY REACHED  WE WOULD KEEP PHILIP WICKSON
A PRISONER AND EDUCATE HIM IN OUR ETHICS AND SOCIOLOGY  BUT IN THE
MEANTIME THERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE  ALL TRACE OF THE YOUNG OLIGARCH MUST
BE OBLITERATED  THERE WERE THE MARKS HE HAD LEFT WHEN DESCENDING THE
CRUMBLING WALL OF THE HOLE  THIS TASK FELL TO BIEDENBACH  AND  SLUNG ON
A ROPE FROM ABOVE  HE TOILED CUNNINGLY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY TILL NO
SIGN REMAINED  BACK UP THE CANYON FROM THE LIP OF THE HOLE ALL MARKS
WERE LIKEWISE REMOVED  THEN  AT TWILIGHT  CAME JOHN CARLSON  WHO
DEMANDED WICKSONS SHOES 

THE YOUNG MAN DID NOT WANT TO GIVE UP HIS SHOES  AND EVEN OFFERED TO
FIGHT FOR THEM  TILL HE FELT THE HORSESHOERS STRENGTH IN ERNESTS
HANDS  CARLSON AFTERWARD REPORTED SEVERAL BLISTERS AND MUCH GRIEVOUS
LOSS OF SKIN DUE TO THE SMALLNESS OF THE SHOES  BUT HE SUCCEEDED IN
DOING GALLANT WORK WITH THEM  BACK FROM THE LIP OF THE HOLE  WHERE ENDED
THE YOUNG MANS OBLITERATED TRIAL  CARLSON PUT ON THE SHOES AND WALKED
AWAY TO THE LEFT  HE WALKED FOR MILES  AROUND KNOLLS  OVER RIDGES AND
THROUGH CANYONS  AND FINALLY COVERED THE TRAIL IN THE RUNNING WATER OF
A CREEKBED  HERE HE REMOVED THE SHOES  AND  STILL HIDING TRAIL FOR A
DISTANCE  AT LAST PUT ON HIS OWN SHOES  A WEEK LATER WICKSON GOT BACK
HIS SHOES 

THAT NIGHT THE HOUNDS WERE OUT  AND THERE WAS LITTLE SLEEP IN THE
REFUGE  NEXT DAY  TIME AND AGAIN  THE BAYING HOUNDS CAME DOWN THE
CANYON  PLUNGED OFF TO THE LEFT ON THE TRAIL CARLSON HAD MADE FOR THEM 
AND WERE LOST TO EAR IN THE FARTHER CANYONS HIGH UP THE MOUNTAIN  AND
ALL THE TIME OUR MEN WAITED IN THE REFUGE  WEAPONS IN HANDAUTOMATIC
REVOLVERS AND RIFLES  TO SAY NOTHING OF HALF A DOZEN INFERNAL MACHINES
OF BIEDENBACHS MANUFACTURE  A MORE SURPRISED PARTY OF RESCUERS COULD
NOT BE IMAGINED  HAD THEY VENTURED DOWN INTO OUR HIDINGPLACE 

I HAVE NOW GIVEN THE TRUE DISAPPEARANCE OF PHILIP WICKSON  ONETIME
OLIGARCH  AND  LATER  COMRADE IN THE REVOLUTION  FOR WE CONVERTED HIM
IN THE END  HIS MIND WAS FRESH AND PLASTIC  AND BY NATURE HE WAS VERY
ETHICAL  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER WE RODE HIM  ON ONE OF HIS FATHERS
HORSES  OVER SONOMA MOUNTAINS TO PETALUMA CREEK AND EMBARKED HIM IN
A SMALL FISHINGLAUNCH  BY EASY STAGES WE SMUGGLED HIM ALONG OUR
UNDERGROUND RAILWAY TO THE CARMEL REFUGE 

THERE HE REMAINED EIGHT MONTHS  AT THE END OF WHICH TIME  FOR TWO
REASONS  HE WAS LOATH TO LEAVE US  ONE REASON WAS THAT HE HAD FALLEN IN
LOVE WITH ANNA ROYLSTON  AND THE OTHER WAS THAT HE HAD BECOME ONE OF
US  IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE BECAME CONVINCED OF THE HOPELESSNESS OF HIS
LOVE AFFAIR THAT HE ACCEDED TO OUR WISHES AND WENT BACK TO HIS FATHER 
OSTENSIBLY AN OLIGARCH UNTIL HIS DEATH  HE WAS IN REALITY ONE OF THE
MOST VALUABLE OF OUR AGENTS  OFTEN AND OFTEN HAS THE IRON HEEL BEEN
DUMBFOUNDED BY THE MISCARRIAGE OF ITS PLANS AND OPERATIONS AGAINST US 
IF IT BUT KNEW THE NUMBER OF ITS OWN MEMBERS WHO ARE OUR AGENTS  IT
WOULD UNDERSTAND  YOUNG WICKSON NEVER WAVERED IN HIS LOYALTY TO THE
CAUSE  IN TRUTH  HIS VERY DEATH WAS INCURRED BY HIS DEVOTION TO DUTY 
IN THE GREAT STORM OF   WHILE ATTENDING A MEETING OF OUR LEADERS  HE
CONTRACTED THE PNEUMONIA OF WHICH HE DIED 

      THE CASE OF THIS YOUNG MAN WAS NOT UNUSUAL   MANY YOUNG
     MEN OF THE OLIGARCHY  IMPELLED BY SENSE OF RIGHT CONDUCT  OR
     THEIR IMAGINATIONS CAPTURED BY THE GLORY OF THE REVOLUTION 
     ETHICALLY OR ROMANTICALLY DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO IT   IN
     SIMILAR WAY  MANY SONS OF THE RUSSIAN NOBILITY PLAYED THEIR
     PARTS IN THE EARLIER AND PROTRACTED REVOLUTION IN THAT
     COUNTRY 


CHAPTER XXI

THE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST


DURING THE LONG PERIOD OF OUR STAY IN THE REFUGE  WE WERE KEPT CLOSELY
IN TOUCH WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD WITHOUT  AND WE WERE
LEARNING THOROUGHLY THE STRENGTH OF THE OLIGARCHY WITH WHICH WE WERE
AT WAR  OUT OF THE FLUX OF TRANSITION THE NEW INSTITUTIONS WERE
FORMING MORE DEFINITELY AND TAKING ON THE APPEARANCE AND ATTRIBUTES
OF PERMANENCE  THE OLIGARCHS HAD SUCCEEDED IN DEVISING A GOVERNMENTAL
MACHINE  AS INTRICATE AS IT WAS VAST  THAT WORKEDAND THIS DESPITE ALL
OUR EFFORTS TO CLOG AND HAMPER 

THIS WAS A SURPRISE TO MANY OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS  THEY HAD NOT
CONCEIVED IT POSSIBLE  NEVERTHELESS THE WORK OF THE COUNTRY WENT ON 
THE MEN TOILED IN THE MINES AND FIELDSPERFORCE THEY WERE NO MORE THAN
SLAVES  AS FOR THE VITAL INDUSTRIES  EVERYTHING PROSPERED  THE MEMBERS
OF THE GREAT LABOR CASTES WERE CONTENTED AND WORKED ON MERRILY  FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES THEY KNEW INDUSTRIAL PEACE  NO MORE WERE THEY
WORRIED BY SLACK TIMES  STRIKE AND LOCKOUT  AND THE UNION LABEL  THEY
LIVED IN MORE COMFORTABLE HOMES AND IN DELIGHTFUL CITIES OF THEIR
OWNDELIGHTFUL COMPARED WITH THE SLUMS AND GHETTOS IN WHICH THEY HAD
FORMERLY DWELT  THEY HAD BETTER FOOD TO EAT  LESS HOURS OF LABOR  MORE
HOLIDAYS  AND A GREATER AMOUNT AND VARIETY OF INTERESTS AND PLEASURES 
AND FOR THEIR LESS FORTUNATE BROTHERS AND SISTERS  THE UNFAVORED
LABORERS  THE DRIVEN PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  THEY CARED NOTHING  AN AGE
OF SELFISHNESS WAS DAWNING UPON MANKIND  AND YET THIS IS NOT ALTOGETHER
TRUE  THE LABOR CASTES WERE HONEYCOMBED BY OUR AGENTSMEN WHOSE
EYES SAW  BEYOND THE BELLYNEED  THE RADIANT FIGURE OF LIBERTY AND
BROTHERHOOD 

ANOTHER GREAT INSTITUTION THAT HAD TAKEN FORM AND WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY
WAS THE MERCENARIES  THIS BODY OF SOLDIERS HAD BEEN EVOLVED OUT OF THE
OLD REGULAR ARMY AND WAS NOW A MILLION STRONG  TO SAY NOTHING OF THE
COLONIAL FORCES  THE MERCENARIES CONSTITUTED A RACE APART  THEY DWELT IN
CITIES OF THEIR OWN WHICH WERE PRACTICALLY SELFGOVERNED  AND THEY
WERE GRANTED MANY PRIVILEGES  BY THEM A LARGE PORTION OF THE PERPLEXING
SURPLUS WAS CONSUMED  THEY WERE LOSING ALL TOUCH AND SYMPATHY WITH
THE REST OF THE PEOPLE  AND  IN FACT  WERE DEVELOPING THEIR OWN CLASS
MORALITY AND CONSCIOUSNESS  AND YET WE HAD THOUSANDS OF OUR AGENTS AMONG
THEM 

      THE MERCENARIES  IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE IRON HEEL  PLAYED
     AN IMPORTANT ROLE   THEY CONSTITUTED THE BALANCE OF POWER IN
     THE STRUGGLES BETWEEN THE LABOR CASTES AND THE OLIGARCHS 
     AND NOW TO ONE SIDE AND NOW TO THE OTHER  THREW THEIR
     STRENGTH ACCORDING TO THE PLAY OF INTRIGUE AND CONSPIRACY 

THE OLIGARCHS THEMSELVES WERE GOING THROUGH A REMARKABLE AND  IT MUST
BE CONFESSED  UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT  AS A CLASS  THEY DISCIPLINED
THEMSELVES  EVERY MEMBER HAD HIS WORK TO DO IN THE WORLD  AND THIS WORK
HE WAS COMPELLED TO DO  THERE WERE NO MORE IDLERICH YOUNG MEN  THEIR
STRENGTH WAS USED TO GIVE UNITED STRENGTH TO THE OLIGARCHY  THEY SERVED
AS LEADERS OF TROOPS AND AS LIEUTENANTS AND CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY 
THEY FOUND CAREERS IN APPLIED SCIENCE  AND MANY OF THEM BECAME GREAT
ENGINEERS  THEY WENT INTO THE MULTITUDINOUS DIVISIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT 
TOOK SERVICE IN THE COLONIAL POSSESSIONS  AND BY TENS OF THOUSANDS WENT
INTO THE VARIOUS SECRET SERVICES  THEY WERE  I MAY SAY  APPRENTICED
TO EDUCATION  TO ART  TO THE CHURCH  TO SCIENCE  TO LITERATURE AND
IN THOSE FIELDS THEY SERVED THE IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF MOULDING THE
THOUGHTPROCESSES OF THE NATION IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PERPETUITY OF
THE OLIGARCHY 

THEY WERE TAUGHT  AND LATER THEY IN TURN TAUGHT  THAT WHAT THEY WERE
DOING WAS RIGHT  THEY ASSIMILATED THE ARISTOCRATIC IDEA FROM THE MOMENT
THEY BEGAN  AS CHILDREN  TO RECEIVE IMPRESSIONS OF THE WORLD  THE
ARISTOCRATIC IDEA WAS WOVEN INTO THE MAKING OF THEM UNTIL IT BECAME BONE
OF THEM AND FLESH OF THEM  THEY LOOKED UPON THEMSELVES AS WILDANIMAL
TRAINERS  RULERS OF BEASTS  FROM BENEATH THEIR FEET ROSE ALWAYS THE
SUBTERRANEAN RUMBLES OF REVOLT  VIOLENT DEATH EVER STALKED IN THEIR
MIDST BOMB AND KNIFE AND BULLET WERE LOOKED UPON AS SO MANY FANGS
OF THE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST THEY MUST DOMINATE IF HUMANITY WERE
TO PERSIST  THEY WERE THE SAVIOURS OF HUMANITY  AND THEY REGARDED
THEMSELVES AS HEROIC AND SACRIFICING LABORERS FOR THE HIGHEST GOOD 

THEY  AS A CLASS  BELIEVED THAT THEY ALONE MAINTAINED CIVILIZATION 
IT WAS THEIR BELIEF THAT IF EVER THEY WEAKENED  THE GREAT BEAST WOULD
INGULF THEM AND EVERYTHING OF BEAUTY AND WONDER AND JOY AND GOOD IN ITS
CAVERNOUS AND SLIMEDRIPPING MAW  WITHOUT THEM  ANARCHY WOULD REIGN AND
HUMANITY WOULD DROP BACKWARD INTO THE PRIMITIVE NIGHT OUT OF WHICH IT
HAD SO PAINFULLY EMERGED  THE HORRID PICTURE OF ANARCHY WAS HELD
ALWAYS BEFORE THEIR CHILDS EYES UNTIL THEY  IN TURN  OBSESSED BY THIS
CULTIVATED FEAR  HELD THE PICTURE OF ANARCHY BEFORE THE EYES OF THE
CHILDREN THAT FOLLOWED THEM  THIS WAS THE BEAST TO BE STAMPED UPON  AND
THE HIGHEST DUTY OF THE ARISTOCRAT WAS TO STAMP UPON IT  IN SHORT 
THEY ALONE  BY THEIR UNREMITTING TOIL AND SACRIFICE  STOOD BETWEEN
WEAK HUMANITY AND THE ALLDEVOURING BEAST AND THEY BELIEVED IT  FIRMLY
BELIEVED IT 

I CANNOT LAY TOO GREAT STRESS UPON THIS HIGH ETHICAL RIGHTEOUSNESS OF
THE WHOLE OLIGARCH CLASS  THIS HAS BEEN THE STRENGTH OF THE IRON HEEL 
AND TOO MANY OF THE COMRADES HAVE BEEN SLOW OR LOATH TO REALIZE IT  MANY
OF THEM HAVE ASCRIBED THE STRENGTH OF THE IRON HEEL TO ITS SYSTEM OF
REWARD AND PUNISHMENT  THIS IS A MISTAKE  HEAVEN AND HELL MAY BE THE
PRIME FACTORS OF ZEAL IN THE RELIGION OF A FANATIC BUT FOR THE GREAT
MAJORITY OF THE RELIGIOUS  HEAVEN AND HELL ARE INCIDENTAL TO RIGHT
AND WRONG  LOVE OF THE RIGHT  DESIRE FOR THE RIGHT  UNHAPPINESS WITH
ANYTHING LESS THAN THE RIGHTIN SHORT  RIGHT CONDUCT  IS THE PRIME
FACTOR OF RELIGION  AND SO WITH THE OLIGARCHY  PRISONS  BANISHMENT AND
DEGRADATION  HONORS AND PALACES AND WONDERCITIES  ARE ALL INCIDENTAL 
THE GREAT DRIVING FORCE OF THE OLIGARCHS IS THE BELIEF THAT THEY ARE
DOING RIGHT  NEVER MIND THE EXCEPTIONS  AND NEVER MIND THE OPPRESSION
AND INJUSTICE IN WHICH THE IRON HEEL WAS CONCEIVED  ALL IS GRANTED  THE
POINT IS THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE OLIGARCHY TODAY LIES IN ITS SATISFIED
CONCEPTION OF ITS OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS 

      OUT OF THE ETHICAL INCOHERENCY AND INCONSISTENCY OF
     CAPITALISM  THE OLIGARCHS EMERGED WITH A NEW ETHICS 
     COHERENT AND DEFINITE  SHARP AND SEVERE AS STEEL  THE MOST
     ABSURD AND UNSCIENTIFIC AND AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST POTENT
     EVER POSSESSED BY ANY TYRANT CLASS  THE OLIGARCHS BELIEVED
     THEIR ETHICS  IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT BIOLOGY AND
     EVOLUTION GAVE THEM THE LIE AND  BECAUSE OF THEIR FAITH 
     FOR THREE CENTURIES THEY WERE ABLE TO HOLD BACK THE MIGHTY
     TIDE OF HUMAN PROGRESSA SPECTACLE  PROFOUND  TREMENDOUS 
     PUZZLING TO THE METAPHYSICAL MORALIST  AND ONE THAT TO THE
     MATERIALIST IS THE CAUSE OF MANY DOUBTS AND
     RECONSIDERATIONS 

FOR THAT MATTER  THE STRENGTH OF THE REVOLUTION  DURING THESE
FRIGHTFUL TWENTY YEARS  HAS RESIDED IN NOTHING ELSE THAN THE SENSE
OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  IN NO OTHER WAY CAN BE EXPLAINED OUR SACRIFICES AND
MARTYRDOMS  FOR NO OTHER REASON DID RUDOLPH MENDENHALL FLAME OUT HIS
SOUL FOR THE CAUSE AND SING HIS WILD SWANSONG THAT LAST NIGHT OF LIFE 
FOR NO OTHER REASON DID HURLBERT DIE UNDER TORTURE  REFUSING TO THE LAST
TO BETRAY HIS COMRADES  FOR NO OTHER REASON HAS ANNA ROYLSTON REFUSED
BLESSED MOTHERHOOD  FOR NO OTHER REASON HAS JOHN CARLSON BEEN THE
FAITHFUL AND UNREWARDED CUSTODIAN OF THE GLEN ELLEN REFUGE  IT DOES
NOT MATTER  YOUNG OR OLD  MAN OR WOMAN  HIGH OR LOW  GENIUS OR CLOD 
GO WHERE ONE WILL AMONG THE COMRADES OF THE REVOLUTION  THE MOTORFORCE
WILL BE FOUND TO BE A GREAT AND ABIDING DESIRE FOR THE RIGHT 

BUT I HAVE RUN AWAY FROM MY NARRATIVE  ERNEST AND I WELL UNDERSTOOD 
BEFORE WE LEFT THE REFUGE  HOW THE STRENGTH OF THE IRON HEEL WAS
DEVELOPING  THE LABOR CASTES  THE MERCENARIES  AND THE GREAT HORDES
OF SECRET AGENTS AND POLICE OF VARIOUS SORTS WERE ALL PLEDGED TO THE
OLIGARCHY  IN THE MAIN  AND IGNORING THE LOSS OF LIBERTY  THEY WERE
BETTER OFF THAN THEY HAD BEEN  ON THE OTHER HAND  THE GREAT HELPLESS
MASS OF THE POPULATION  THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  WAS SINKING INTO A
BRUTISH APATHY OF CONTENT WITH MISERY  WHENEVER STRONG PROLETARIANS
ASSERTED THEIR STRENGTH IN THE MIDST OF THE MASS  THEY WERE DRAWN AWAY
FROM THE MASS BY THE OLIGARCHS AND GIVEN BETTER CONDITIONS BY BEING MADE
MEMBERS OF THE LABOR CASTES OR OF THE MERCENARIES  THUS DISCONTENT WAS
LULLED AND THE PROLETARIAT ROBBED OF ITS NATURAL LEADERS 

THE CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS WAS PITIABLE  COMMON SCHOOL
EDUCATION  SO FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED  HAD CEASED  THEY LIVED
LIKE BEASTS IN GREAT SQUALID LABORGHETTOS  FESTERING IN MISERY AND
DEGRADATION  ALL THEIR OLD LIBERTIES WERE GONE  THEY WERE LABORSLAVES 
CHOICE OF WORK WAS DENIED THEM  LIKEWISE WAS DENIED THEM THE RIGHT TO
MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE  OR THE RIGHT TO BEAR OR POSSESS ARMS  THEY
WERE NOT LAND SERFS LIKE THE FARMERS  THEY WERE MACHINESERFS AND
LABORSERFS  WHEN UNUSUAL NEEDS AROSE FOR THEM  SUCH AS THE BUILDING
OF THE GREAT HIGHWAYS AND AIRLINES  OF CANALS  TUNNELS  SUBWAYS  AND
FORTIFICATIONS  LEVIES WERE MADE ON THE LABORGHETTOS  AND TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF SERFS  WILLYNILLY  WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE SCENE OF
OPERATIONS  GREAT ARMIES OF THEM ARE TOILING NOW AT THE BUILDING OF
ARDIS  HOUSED IN WRETCHED BARRACKS WHERE FAMILY LIFE CANNOT EXIST  AND
WHERE DECENCY IS DISPLACED BY DULL BESTIALITY  IN ALL TRUTH  THERE IN
THE LABORGHETTOS IS THE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST THE OLIGARCHS FEAR SO
DREADFULLYBUT IT IS THE BEAST OF THEIR OWN MAKING  IN IT THEY WILL NOT
LET THE APE AND TIGER DIE 

AND JUST NOW THE WORD HAS GONE FORTH THAT NEW LEVIES ARE BEING IMPOSED
FOR THE BUILDING OF ASGARD  THE PROJECTED WONDERCITY THAT WILL FAR
EXCEED ARDIS WHEN THE LATTER IS COMPLETED  WE OF THE REVOLUTION WILL GO
ON WITH THAT GREAT WORK  BUT IT WILL NOT BE DONE BY THE MISERABLE SERFS 
THE WALLS AND TOWERS AND SHAFTS OF THAT FAIR CITY WILL ARISE TO THE
SOUND OF SINGING  AND INTO ITS BEAUTY AND WONDER WILL BE WOVEN  NOT
SIGHS AND GROANS  BUT MUSIC AND LAUGHTER 

      ARDIS WAS COMPLETED IN  A D   ASGARD WAS NOT COMPLETED
     UNTIL  A D   IT WAS FIFTYTWO YEARS IN THE BUILDING 
     DURING WHICH TIME A PERMANENT ARMY OF HALF A MILLION SERFS
     WAS EMPLOYED   AT TIMES THESE NUMBERS SWELLED TO OVER A
     MILLIONWITHOUT ANY ACCOUNT BEING TAKEN OF THE HUNDREDS OF
     THOUSANDS OF THE LABOR CASTES AND THE ARTISTS 

ERNEST WAS MADLY IMPATIENT TO BE OUT IN THE WORLD AND DOING  FOR OUR
ILLFATED FIRST REVOLT  THAT HAD MISCARRIED IN THE CHICAGO COMMUNE  WAS
RIPENING FAST  YET HE POSSESSED HIS SOUL WITH PATIENCE  AND DURING THIS
TIME OF HIS TORMENT  WHEN HADLY  WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT FOR THE PURPOSE
FROM ILLINOIS  MADE HIM OVER INTO ANOTHER MAN HE REVOLVED GREAT PLANS
IN HIS HEAD FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF THE LEARNED PROLETARIAT  AND FOR THE
MAINTENANCE OF AT LEAST THE RUDIMENTS OF EDUCATION AMONGST THE PEOPLE OF
THE ABYSSALL THIS OF COURSE IN THE EVENT OF THE FIRST REVOLT BEING A
FAILURE 

      AMONG THE REVOLUTIONISTS WERE MANY SURGEONS  AND IN
     VIVISECTION THEY ATTAINED MARVELLOUS PROFICIENCY   IN AVIS
     EVERHARDS WORDS  THEY COULD LITERALLY MAKE A MAN OVER   TO
     THEM THE ELIMINATION OF SCARS AND DISFIGUREMENTS WAS A
     TRIVIAL DETAIL   THEY CHANGED THE FEATURES WITH SUCH
     MICROSCOPIC CARE THAT NO TRACES WERE LEFT OF THEIR
     HANDIWORK   THE NOSE WAS A FAVORITE ORGAN TO WORK UPON 
     SKINGRAFTING AND HAIRTRANSPLANTING WERE AMONG THEIR
     COMMONEST DEVICES   THE CHANGES IN EXPRESSION THEY
     ACCOMPLISHED WERE WIZARDLIKE   EYES AND EYEBROWS  LIPS 
     MOUTHS  AND EARS  WERE RADICALLY ALTERED   BY CUNNING
     OPERATIONS ON TONGUE  THROAT  LARYNX  AND NASAL CAVITIES A
     MANS WHOLE ENUNCIATION AND MANNER OF SPEECH COULD BE
     CHANGED   DESPERATE TIMES GIVE NEED FOR DESPERATE REMEDIES 
     AND THE SURGEONS OF THE REVOLUTION ROSE TO THE NEED   AMONG
     OTHER THINGS  THEY COULD INCREASE AN ADULTS STATURE BY AS
     MUCH AS FOUR OR FIVE INCHES AND DECREASE IT BY ONE OR TWO
     INCHES   WHAT THEY DID IS TODAY A LOST ART   WE HAVE NO
     NEED FOR IT 

IT WAS NOT UNTIL JANUARY    THAT WE LEFT THE REFUGE  ALL HAD BEEN
ARRANGED  WE TOOK OUR PLACE AT ONCE AS AGENTSPROVOCATEURS IN THE SCHEME
OF THE IRON HEEL  I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ERNESTS SISTER  BY OLIGARCHS AND
COMRADES ON THE INSIDE WHO WERE HIGH IN AUTHORITY  PLACE HAD BEEN MADE
FOR US  WE WERE IN POSSESSION OF ALL NECESSARY DOCUMENTS  AND OUR PASTS
WERE ACCOUNTED FOR  WITH HELP ON THE INSIDE  THIS WAS NOT DIFFICULT 
FOR IN THAT SHADOWWORLD OF SECRET SERVICE IDENTITY WAS NEBULOUS  LIKE
GHOSTS THE AGENTS CAME AND WENT  OBEYING COMMANDS  FULFILLING DUTIES 
FOLLOWING CLEWS  MAKING THEIR REPORTS OFTEN TO OFFICERS THEY NEVER SAW
OR COOPERATING WITH OTHER AGENTS THEY HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND WOULD
NEVER SEE AGAIN 



CHAPTER XXII

THE CHICAGO COMMUNE


AS AGENTSPROVOCATEURS  NOT ALONE WERE WE ABLE TO TRAVEL A GREAT DEAL 
BUT OUR VERY WORK THREW US IN CONTACT WITH THE PROLETARIAT AND WITH OUR
COMRADES  THE REVOLUTIONISTS  THUS WE WERE IN BOTH CAMPS AT THE SAME
TIME  OSTENSIBLY SERVING THE IRON HEEL AND SECRETLY WORKING WITH ALL
OUR MIGHT FOR THE CAUSE  THERE WERE MANY OF US IN THE VARIOUS
SECRET SERVICES OF THE OLIGARCHY  AND DESPITE THE SHAKINGSUP AND
REORGANIZATIONS THE SECRET SERVICES HAVE UNDERGONE  THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN
ABLE TO WEED ALL OF US OUT 

ERNEST HAD LARGELY PLANNED THE FIRST REVOLT  AND THE DATE SET HAD BEEN
SOMEWHERE EARLY IN THE SPRING OF   IN THE FALL OF  WE WERE NOT
READY MUCH REMAINED TO BE DONE  AND WHEN THE REVOLT WAS PRECIPITATED 
OF COURSE IT WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE  THE PLOT OF NECESSITY WAS
FRIGHTFULLY INTRICATE  AND ANYTHING PREMATURE WAS SURE TO DESTROY IT 
THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY 

WE HAD PLANNED TO STRIKE OUR FIRST BLOW AT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE
OLIGARCHY  THE LATTER HAD REMEMBERED THE GENERAL STRIKE  AND HAD
GUARDED AGAINST THE DEFECTION OF THE TELEGRAPHERS BY INSTALLING WIRELESS
STATIONS  IN THE CONTROL OF THE MERCENARIES  WE  IN TURN  HAD COUNTERED
THIS MOVE  WHEN THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN  FROM EVERY REFUGE  ALL OVER THE
LAND  AND FROM THE CITIES  AND TOWNS  AND BARRACKS  DEVOTED COMRADES
WERE TO GO FORTH AND BLOW UP THE WIRELESS STATIONS  THUS AT THE FIRST
SHOCK WOULD THE IRON HEEL BE BROUGHT TO EARTH AND LIE PRACTICALLY
DISMEMBERED 

AT THE SAME MOMENT  OTHER COMRADES WERE TO BLOW UP THE BRIDGES AND
TUNNELS AND DISRUPT THE WHOLE NETWORK OF RAILROADS  STILL FURTHER  OTHER
GROUPS OF COMRADES  AT THE SIGNAL  WERE TO SEIZE THE OFFICERS OF THE
MERCENARIES AND THE POLICE  AS WELL AS ALL OLIGARCHS OF UNUSUAL ABILITY
OR WHO HELD EXECUTIVE POSITIONS  THUS WOULD THE LEADERS OF THE ENEMY
BE REMOVED FROM THE FIELD OF THE LOCAL BATTLES THAT WOULD INEVITABLY BE
FOUGHT ALL OVER THE LAND 

MANY THINGS WERE TO OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY WHEN THE SIGNAL WENT FORTH  THE
CANADIAN AND MEXICAN PATRIOTS  WHO WERE FAR STRONGER THAN THE IRON HEEL
DREAMED  WERE TO DUPLICATE OUR TACTICS  THEN THERE WERE COMRADES THESE
WERE THE WOMEN  FOR THE MEN WOULD BE BUSY ELSEWHERE WHO WERE TO POST
THE PROCLAMATIONS FROM OUR SECRET PRESSES  THOSE OF US IN THE HIGHER
EMPLOY OF THE IRON HEEL WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO MAKE CONFUSION
AND ANARCHY IN ALL OUR DEPARTMENTS  INSIDE THE MERCENARIES WERE
THOUSANDS OF OUR COMRADES  THEIR WORK WAS TO BLOW UP THE MAGAZINES
AND TO DESTROY THE DELICATE MECHANISM OF ALL THE WAR MACHINERY  IN THE
CITIES OF THE MERCENARIES AND OF THE LABOR CASTES SIMILAR PROGRAMMES OF
DISRUPTION WERE TO BE CARRIED OUT 

IN SHORT  A SUDDEN  COLOSSAL  STUNNING BLOW WAS TO BE STRUCK  BEFORE THE
PARALYZED OLIGARCHY COULD RECOVER ITSELF  ITS END WOULD HAVE COME 
IT WOULD HAVE MEANT TERRIBLE TIMES AND GREAT LOSS OF LIFE  BUT NO
REVOLUTIONIST HESITATES AT SUCH THINGS  WHY  WE EVEN DEPENDED MUCH  IN
OUR PLAN  ON THE UNORGANIZED PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  THEY WERE TO BE LOOSED
ON THE PALACES AND CITIES OF THE MASTERS  NEVER MIND THE DESTRUCTION
OF LIFE AND PROPERTY  LET THE ABYSMAL BRUTE ROAR AND THE POLICE AND
MERCENARIES SLAY  THE ABYSMAL BRUTE WOULD ROAR ANYWAY  AND THE POLICE
AND MERCENARIES WOULD SLAY ANYWAY  IT WOULD MERELY MEAN THAT VARIOUS
DANGERS TO US WERE HARMLESSLY DESTROYING ONE ANOTHER  IN THE MEANTIME WE
WOULD BE DOING OUR OWN WORK  LARGELY UNHAMPERED  AND GAINING CONTROL OF
ALL THE MACHINERY OF SOCIETY 

SUCH WAS OUR PLAN  EVERY DETAIL OF WHICH HAD TO BE WORKED OUT IN SECRET 
AND  AS THE DAY DREW NEAR  COMMUNICATED TO MORE AND MORE COMRADES 
THIS WAS THE DANGER POINT  THE STRETCHING OF THE CONSPIRACY  BUT THAT
DANGERPOINT WAS NEVER REACHED  THROUGH ITS SPYSYSTEM THE IRON HEEL
GOT WIND OF THE REVOLT AND PREPARED TO TEACH US ANOTHER OF ITS BLOODY
LESSONS  CHICAGO WAS THE DEVOTED CITY SELECTED FOR THE INSTRUCTION  AND
WELL WERE WE INSTRUCTED 

CHICAGO WAS THE RIPEST OF ALLCHICAGO WHICH OF OLD TIME WAS THE CITY
OF BLOOD AND WHICH WAS TO EARN ANEW ITS NAME  THERE THE REVOLUTIONARY
SPIRIT WAS STRONG  TOO MANY BITTER STRIKES HAD BEEN CURBED THERE IN THE
DAYS OF CAPITALISM FOR THE WORKERS TO FORGET AND FORGIVE  EVEN THE
LABOR CASTES OF THE CITY WERE ALIVE WITH REVOLT  TOO MANY HEADS HAD
BEEN BROKEN IN THE EARLY STRIKES  DESPITE THEIR CHANGED AND FAVORABLE
CONDITIONS  THEIR HATRED FOR THE MASTER CLASS HAD NOT DIED  THIS SPIRIT
HAD INFECTED THE MERCENARIES  OF WHICH THREE REGIMENTS IN PARTICULAR
WERE READY TO COME OVER TO US EN MASSE 

      CHICAGO WAS THE INDUSTRIAL INFERNO OF THE NINETEENTH
     CENTURY A D  A CURIOUS ANECDOTE HAS COME DOWN TO US OF JOHN
     BURNS  A GREAT ENGLISH LABOR LEADER AND ONE TIME MEMBER OF
     THE BRITISH CABINET  IN CHICAGO  WHILE ON A VISIT TO THE
     UNITED STATES  HE WAS ASKED BY A NEWSPAPER REPORTER FOR HIS
     OPINION OF THAT CITY   CHICAGO  HE ANSWERED  IS A POCKET
     EDITION OF HELL   SOME TIME LATER  AS HE WAS GOING ABOARD
     HIS STEAMER TO SAIL TO ENGLAND  HE WAS APPROACHED BY ANOTHER
     REPORTER  WHO WANTED TO KNOW IF HE HAD CHANGED HIS OPINION
     OF CHICAGO   YES  I HAVE  WAS HIS REPLY   MY PRESENT
     OPINION IS THAT HELL IS A POCKET EDITION OF CHICAGO 

CHICAGO HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE STORMCENTRE OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN
LABOR AND CAPITAL  A CITY OF STREETBATTLES AND VIOLENT DEATH  WITH A
CLASSCONSCIOUS CAPITALIST ORGANIZATION AND A CLASSCONSCIOUS WORKMAN
ORGANIZATION  WHERE  IN THE OLD DAYS  THE VERY SCHOOLTEACHERS WERE
FORMED INTO LABOR UNIONS AND AFFILIATED WITH THE HODCARRIERS AND
BRICKLAYERS IN THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR  AND CHICAGO BECAME THE
STORMCENTRE OF THE PREMATURE FIRST REVOLT 

THE TROUBLE WAS PRECIPITATED BY THE IRON HEEL  IT WAS CLEVERLY DONE  THE
WHOLE POPULATION  INCLUDING THE FAVORED LABOR CASTES  WAS GIVEN A COURSE
OF OUTRAGEOUS TREATMENT  PROMISES AND AGREEMENTS WERE BROKEN  AND MOST
DRASTIC PUNISHMENTS VISITED UPON EVEN PETTY OFFENDERS  THE PEOPLE OF
THE ABYSS WERE TORMENTED OUT OF THEIR APATHY  IN FACT  THE IRON HEEL WAS
PREPARING TO MAKE THE ABYSMAL BEAST ROAR  AND HAND IN HAND WITH THIS  IN
ALL PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES IN CHICAGO  THE IRON HEEL WAS INCONCEIVABLY
CARELESS  DISCIPLINE WAS RELAXED AMONG THE MERCENARIES THAT REMAINED 
WHILE MANY REGIMENTS HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN AND SENT TO VARIOUS PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY 

IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO CARRY OUT THIS PROGRAMMEONLY SEVERAL WEEKS  WE
OF THE REVOLUTION CAUGHT VAGUE RUMORS OF THE STATE OF AFFAIRS  BUT HAD
NOTHING DEFINITE ENOUGH FOR AN UNDERSTANDING  IN FACT  WE THOUGHT IT WAS
A SPONTANEOUS SPIRIT OF REVOLT THAT WOULD REQUIRE CAREFUL CURBING ON OUR
PART  AND NEVER DREAMED THAT IT WAS DELIBERATELY MANUFACTUREDAND IT
HAD BEEN MANUFACTURED SO SECRETLY  FROM THE VERY INNERMOST CIRCLE OF
THE IRON HEEL  THAT WE HAD GOT NO INKLING  THE COUNTERPLOT WAS AN ABLE
ACHIEVEMENT  AND ABLY CARRIED OUT 

I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN I RECEIVED THE ORDER TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO
CHICAGO  THE MAN WHO GAVE ME THE ORDER WAS ONE OF THE OLIGARCHS  I COULD
TELL THAT BY HIS SPEECH  THOUGH I DID NOT KNOW HIS NAME NOR SEE HIS
FACE  HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE TOO CLEAR FOR ME TO MAKE A MISTAKE  PLAINLY
I READ BETWEEN THE LINES THAT OUR PLOT HAD BEEN DISCOVERED  THAT WE HAD
BEEN COUNTERMINED  THE EXPLOSION WAS READY FOR THE FLASH OF POWDER  AND
COUNTLESS AGENTS OF THE IRON HEEL  INCLUDING ME  EITHER ON THE GROUND
OR BEING SENT THERE  WERE TO SUPPLY THAT FLASH  I FLATTER MYSELF THAT I
MAINTAINED MY COMPOSURE UNDER THE KEEN EYE OF THE OLIGARCH  BUT MY HEART
WAS BEATING MADLY  I COULD ALMOST HAVE SHRIEKED AND FLOWN AT HIS THROAT
WITH MY NAKED HANDS BEFORE HIS FINAL  COLDBLOODED INSTRUCTIONS WERE
GIVEN 

ONCE OUT OF HIS PRESENCE  I CALCULATED THE TIME  I HAD JUST THE MOMENTS
TO SPARE  IF I WERE LUCKY  TO GET IN TOUCH WITH SOME LOCAL LEADER BEFORE
CATCHING MY TRAIN  GUARDING AGAINST BEING TRAILED  I MADE A RUSH OF IT
FOR THE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL  LUCK WAS WITH ME  AND I GAINED ACCESS AT
ONCE TO COMRADE GALVIN  THE SURGEONINCHIEF  I STARTED TO GASP OUT MY
INFORMATION  BUT HE STOPPED ME 

I ALREADY KNOW  HE SAID QUIETLY  THOUGH HIS IRISH EYES WERE FLASHING 
I KNEW WHAT YOU HAD COME FOR  I GOT THE WORD FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO  AND I
HAVE ALREADY PASSED IT ALONG  EVERYTHING SHALL BE DONE HERE TO KEEP THE
COMRADES QUIET  CHICAGO IS TO BE SACRIFICED  BUT IT SHALL BE CHICAGO
ALONE 

HAVE YOU TRIED TO GET WORD TO CHICAGO I ASKED 

HE SHOOK HIS HEAD  NO TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION  CHICAGO IS SHUT OFF 
ITS GOING TO BE HELL THERE 

HE PAUSED A MOMENT  AND I SAW HIS WHITE HANDS CLINCH  THEN HE BURST OUT 

BY GOD I WISH I WERE GOING TO BE THERE

THERE IS YET A CHANCE TO STOP IT  I SAID  IF NOTHING HAPPENS TO
THE TRAIN AND I CAN GET THERE IN TIME  OR IF SOME OF THE OTHER
SECRETSERVICE COMRADES WHO HAVE LEARNED THE TRUTH CAN GET THERE IN
TIME 

YOU ON THE INSIDE WERE CAUGHT NAPPING THIS TIME  HE SAID 

I NODDED MY HEAD HUMBLY 

IT WAS VERY SECRET  I ANSWERED  ONLY THE INNER CHIEFS COULD HAVE
KNOWN UP TO TODAY  WE HAVENT YET PENETRATED THAT FAR  SO WE COULDNT
ESCAPE BEING KEPT IN THE DARK  IF ONLY ERNEST WERE HERE  MAYBE HE IS IN
CHICAGO NOW  AND ALL IS WELL 

DR  GALVIN SHOOK HIS HEAD  THE LAST NEWS I HEARD OF HIM WAS THAT HE HAD
BEEN SENT TO BOSTON OR NEW HAVEN  THIS SECRET SERVICE FOR THE ENEMY MUST
HAMPER HIM A LOT  BUT ITS BETTER THAN LYING IN A REFUGE 

I STARTED TO GO  AND GALVIN WRUNG MY HAND 

KEEP A STOUT HEART  WERE HIS PARTING WORDS  WHAT IF THE FIRST REVOLT
IS LOST THERE WILL BE A SECOND  AND WE WILL BE WISER THEN  GOODBY AND
GOOD LUCK  I DONT KNOW WHETHER ILL EVER SEE YOU AGAIN  ITS GOING TO
BE HELL THERE  BUT ID GIVE TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE FOR YOUR CHANCE TO BE
IN IT 

THE TWENTIETH CENTURY LEFT NEW YORK AT SIX IN THE EVENING  AND WAS
SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE AT CHICAGO AT SEVEN NEXT MORNING  BUT IT LOST TIME
THAT NIGHT  WE WERE RUNNING BEHIND ANOTHER TRAIN  AMONG THE TRAVELLERS
IN MY PULLMAN WAS COMRADE HARTMAN  LIKE MYSELF IN THE SECRET SERVICE
OF THE IRON HEEL  HE IT WAS WHO TOLD ME OF THE TRAIN THAT IMMEDIATELY
PRECEDED US  IT WAS AN EXACT DUPLICATE OF OUR TRAIN  THOUGH IT CONTAINED
NO PASSENGERS  THE IDEA WAS THAT THE EMPTY TRAIN SHOULD RECEIVE THE
DISASTER WERE AN ATTEMPT MADE TO BLOW UP THE TWENTIETH CENTURY  FOR THAT
MATTER THERE WERE VERY FEW PEOPLE ON THE TRAINONLY A BAKERS DOZEN IN
OUR CAR 

      THIS WAS REPUTED TO BE THE FASTEST TRAIN IN THE WORLD
     THEN   IT WAS QUITE A FAMOUS TRAIN 

THERE MUST BE SOME BIG MEN ON BOARD  HARTMAN CONCLUDED  I NOTICED A
PRIVATE CAR ON THE REAR 

NIGHT HAD FALLEN WHEN WE MADE OUR FIRST CHANGE OF ENGINE  AND I WALKED
DOWN THE PLATFORM FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR AND TO SEE WHAT I COULD SEE 
THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE PRIVATE CAR I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THREE
MEN WHOM I RECOGNIZED  HARTMAN WAS RIGHT  ONE OF THE MEN WAS GENERAL
ALTENDORFF AND THE OTHER TWO WERE MASON AND VANDERBOLD  THE BRAINS OF
THE INNER CIRCLE OF THE OLIGARCHYS SECRET SERVICE 

IT WAS A QUIET MOONLIGHT NIGHT  BUT I TOSSED RESTLESSLY AND COULD NOT
SLEEP  AT FIVE IN THE MORNING I DRESSED AND ABANDONED MY BED 

I ASKED THE MAID IN THE DRESSINGROOM HOW LATE THE TRAIN WAS  AND SHE
TOLD ME TWO HOURS  SHE WAS A MULATTO WOMAN  AND I NOTICED THAT HER
FACE WAS HAGGARD  WITH GREAT CIRCLES UNDER THE EYES  WHILE THE EYES
THEMSELVES WERE WIDE WITH SOME HAUNTING FEAR 

WHAT IS THE MATTER I ASKED 

NOTHING  MISS I DIDNT SLEEP WELL  I GUESS  WAS HER REPLY 

I LOOKED AT HER CLOSELY  AND TRIED HER WITH ONE OF OUR SIGNALS  SHE
RESPONDED  AND I MADE SURE OF HER 

SOMETHING TERRIBLE IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN CHICAGO  SHE SAID  THERES
THAT FAKE TRAIN IN FRONT OF US  THAT AND THE TROOPTRAINS HAVE MADE US
LATE 

      FALSE 

TROOPTRAINS I QUERIED 

SHE NODDED HER HEAD  THE LINE IS THICK WITH THEM  WEVE BEEN PASSING
THEM ALL NIGHT  AND THEYRE ALL HEADING FOR CHICAGO  AND BRINGING THEM
OVER THE AIRLINETHAT MEANS BUSINESS 

IVE A LOVER IN CHICAGO  SHE ADDED APOLOGETICALLY  HES ONE OF US 
AND HES IN THE MERCENARIES  AND IM AFRAID FOR HIM 

POOR GIRL  HER LOVER WAS IN ONE OF THE THREE DISLOYAL REGIMENTS 

HARTMAN AND I HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER IN THE DINING CAR  AND I FORCED
MYSELF TO EAT  THE SKY HAD CLOUDED  AND THE TRAIN RUSHED ON LIKE A
SULLEN THUNDERBOLT THROUGH THE GRAY PALL OF ADVANCING DAY  THE VERY
NEGROES THAT WAITED ON US KNEW THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE WAS IMPENDING 
OPPRESSION SAT HEAVILY UPON THEM THE LIGHTNESS OF THEIR NATURES HAD
EBBED OUT OF THEM THEY WERE SLACK AND ABSENTMINDED IN THEIR SERVICE 
AND THEY WHISPERED GLOOMILY TO ONE ANOTHER IN THE FAR END OF THE CAR
NEXT TO THE KITCHEN  HARTMAN WAS HOPELESS OVER THE SITUATION 

WHAT CAN WE DO HE DEMANDED FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME  WITH A HELPLESS
SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS 

HE POINTED OUT OF THE WINDOW  SEE  ALL IS READY  YOU CAN DEPEND UPON IT
THAT THEYRE HOLDING THEM LIKE THIS  THIRTY OR FORTY MILES OUTSIDE THE
CITY  ON EVERY ROAD 

HE HAD REFERENCE TO TROOPTRAINS ON THE SIDETRACK  THE SOLDIERS WERE
COOKING THEIR BREAKFASTS OVER FIRES BUILT ON THE GROUND BESIDE THE
TRACK  AND THEY LOOKED UP CURIOUSLY AT US AS WE THUNDERED PAST WITHOUT
SLACKENING OUR TERRIFIC SPEED 

ALL WAS QUIET AS WE ENTERED CHICAGO  IT WAS EVIDENT NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
YET  IN THE SUBURBS THE MORNING PAPERS CAME ON BOARD THE TRAIN  THERE
WAS NOTHING IN THEM  AND YET THERE WAS MUCH IN THEM FOR THOSE SKILLED
IN READING BETWEEN THE LINES THAT IT WAS INTENDED THE ORDINARY READER
SHOULD READ INTO THE TEXT  THE FINE HAND OF THE IRON HEEL WAS APPARENT
IN EVERY COLUMN  GLIMMERINGS OF WEAKNESS IN THE ARMOR OF THE OLIGARCHY
WERE GIVEN  OF COURSE  THERE WAS NOTHING DEFINITE  IT WAS INTENDED THAT
THE READER SHOULD FEEL HIS WAY TO THESE GLIMMERINGS  IT WAS
CLEVERLY DONE  AS FICTION  THOSE MORNING PAPERS OF OCTOBER TH WERE
MASTERPIECES 

THE LOCAL NEWS WAS MISSING  THIS IN ITSELF WAS A MASTERSTROKE  IT
SHROUDED CHICAGO IN MYSTERY  AND IT SUGGESTED TO THE AVERAGE CHICAGO
READER THAT THE OLIGARCHY DID NOT DARE GIVE THE LOCAL NEWS  HINTS THAT
WERE UNTRUE  OF COURSE  WERE GIVEN OF INSUBORDINATION ALL OVER THE LAND 
CRUDELY DISGUISED WITH COMPLACENT REFERENCES TO PUNITIVE MEASURES TO BE
TAKEN  THERE WERE REPORTS OF NUMEROUS WIRELESS STATIONS THAT HAD
BEEN BLOWN UP  WITH HEAVY REWARDS OFFERED FOR THE DETECTION OF THE
PERPETRATORS  OF COURSE NO WIRELESS STATIONS HAD BEEN BLOWN UP  MANY
SIMILAR OUTRAGES  THAT DOVETAILED WITH THE PLOT OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS 
WERE GIVEN  THE IMPRESSION TO BE MADE ON THE MINDS OF THE CHICAGO
COMRADES WAS THAT THE GENERAL REVOLT WAS BEGINNING  ALBEIT WITH A
CONFUSING MISCARRIAGE IN MANY DETAILS  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ONE
UNINFORMED TO ESCAPE THE VAGUE YET CERTAIN FEELING THAT ALL THE LAND WAS
RIPE FOR THE REVOLT THAT HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO BREAK OUT 

IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE DEFECTION OF THE MERCENARIES IN CALIFORNIA HAD
BECOME SO SERIOUS THAT HALF A DOZEN REGIMENTS HAD BEEN DISBANDED AND
BROKEN  AND THAT THEIR MEMBERS WITH THEIR FAMILIES HAD BEEN DRIVEN
FROM THEIR OWN CITY AND ON INTO THE LABORGHETTOS  AND THE CALIFORNIA
MERCENARIES WERE IN REALITY THE MOST FAITHFUL OF ALL TO THEIR SALT
BUT HOW WAS CHICAGO  SHUT OFF FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD  TO KNOW THEN
THERE WAS A RAGGED TELEGRAM DESCRIBING AN OUTBREAK OF THE POPULACE IN
NEW YORK CITY  IN WHICH THE LABOR CASTES WERE JOINING  CONCLUDING WITH
THE STATEMENT INTENDED TO BE ACCEPTED AS A BLUFF THAT THE TROOPS HAD
THE SITUATION IN HAND 

      A LIE 

AND AS THE OLIGARCHS HAD DONE WITH THE MORNING PAPERS  SO HAD THEY DONE
IN A THOUSAND OTHER WAYS  THESE WE LEARNED AFTERWARD  AS  FOR EXAMPLE 
THE SECRET MESSAGES OF THE OLIGARCHS  SENT WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF
LEAKING TO THE EARS OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS  THAT HAD COME OVER THE WIRES 
NOW AND AGAIN  DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE NIGHT 

I GUESS THE IRON HEEL WONT NEED OUR SERVICES  HARTMAN REMARKED 
PUTTING DOWN THE PAPER HE HAD BEEN READING  WHEN THE TRAIN PULLED INTO
THE CENTRAL DEPOT  THEY WASTED THEIR TIME SENDING US HERE  THEIR PLANS
HAVE EVIDENTLY PROSPERED BETTER THAN THEY EXPECTED  HELL WILL BREAK
LOOSE ANY SECOND NOW 

HE TURNED AND LOOKED DOWN THE TRAIN AS WE ALIGHTED 

I THOUGHT SO  HE MUTTERED  THEY DROPPED THAT PRIVATE CAR WHEN THE
PAPERS CAME ABOARD 

HARTMAN WAS HOPELESSLY DEPRESSED  I TRIED TO CHEER HIM UP  BUT HE
IGNORED MY EFFORT AND SUDDENLY BEGAN TALKING VERY HURRIEDLY  IN A
LOW VOICE  AS WE PASSED THROUGH THE STATION  AT FIRST I COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND 

I HAVE NOT BEEN SURE  HE WAS SAYING  AND I HAVE TOLD NO ONE  I HAVE
BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR WEEKS  AND I CANNOT MAKE SURE  WATCH OUT FOR
KNOWLTON  I SUSPECT HIM  HE KNOWS THE SECRETS OF A SCORE OF OUR REFUGES 
HE CARRIES THE LIVES OF HUNDREDS OF US IN HIS HANDS  AND I THINK HE IS
A TRAITOR  ITS MORE A FEELING ON MY PART THAN ANYTHING ELSE  BUT I
THOUGHT I MARKED A CHANGE IN HIM A SHORT WHILE BACK  THERE IS THE DANGER
THAT HE HAS SOLD US OUT  OR IS GOING TO SELL US OUT  I AM ALMOST SURE
OF IT  I WOULDNT WHISPER MY SUSPICIONS TO A SOUL  BUT  SOMEHOW  I DONT
THINK ILL LEAVE CHICAGO ALIVE  KEEP YOUR EYE ON KNOWLTON  TRAP HIM 
FIND OUT  I DONT KNOW ANYTHING MORE  IT IS ONLY AN INTUITION  AND SO
FAR I HAVE FAILED TO FIND THE SLIGHTEST CLEW  WE WERE JUST STEPPING OUT
UPON THE SIDEWALK  REMEMBER  HARTMAN CONCLUDED EARNESTLY  KEEP YOUR
EYES UPON KNOWLTON 

AND HARTMAN WAS RIGHT  BEFORE A MONTH WENT BY KNOWLTON PAID FOR HIS
TREASON WITH HIS LIFE  HE WAS FORMALLY EXECUTED BY THE COMRADES IN
MILWAUKEE 

ALL WAS QUIET ON THE STREETSTOO QUIET  CHICAGO LAY DEAD  THERE WAS NO
ROAR AND RUMBLE OF TRAFFIC  THERE WERE NOT EVEN CABS ON THE STREETS  THE
SURFACE CARS AND THE ELEVATED WERE NOT RUNNING  ONLY OCCASIONALLY  ON
THE SIDEWALKS  WERE THERE STRAY PEDESTRIANS  AND THESE PEDESTRIANS DID
NOT LOITER  THEY WENT THEIR WAYS WITH GREAT HASTE AND DEFINITENESS 
WITHAL THERE WAS A CURIOUS INDECISION IN THEIR MOVEMENTS  AS THOUGH THEY
EXPECTED THE BUILDINGS TO TOPPLE OVER ON THEM OR THE SIDEWALKS TO SINK
UNDER THEIR FEET OR FLY UP IN THE AIR  A FEW GAMINS  HOWEVER  WERE
AROUND  IN THEIR EYES A SUPPRESSED EAGERNESS IN ANTICIPATION OF
WONDERFUL AND EXCITING THINGS TO HAPPEN 

FROM SOMEWHERE  FAR TO THE SOUTH  THE DULL SOUND OF AN EXPLOSION CAME TO
OUR EARS  THAT WAS ALL  THEN QUIET AGAIN  THOUGH THE GAMINS HAD STARTLED
AND LISTENED  LIKE YOUNG DEER  AT THE SOUND  THE DOORWAYS TO ALL THE
BUILDINGS WERE CLOSED THE SHUTTERS TO THE SHOPS WERE UP  BUT THERE
WERE MANY POLICE AND WATCHMEN IN EVIDENCE  AND NOW AND AGAIN AUTOMOBILE
PATROLS OF THE MERCENARIES SLIPPED SWIFTLY PAST 

HARTMAN AND I AGREED THAT IT WAS USELESS TO REPORT OURSELVES TO THE
LOCAL CHIEFS OF THE SECRET SERVICE  OUR FAILURE SO TO REPORT WOULD BE
EXCUSED  WE KNEW  IN THE LIGHT OF SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  SO WE HEADED FOR
THE GREAT LABORGHETTO ON THE SOUTH SIDE IN THE HOPE OF GETTING IN
CONTACT WITH SOME OF THE COMRADES  TOO LATE WE KNEW IT  BUT WE COULD
NOT STAND STILL AND DO NOTHING IN THOSE GHASTLY  SILENT STREETS  WHERE
WAS ERNEST I WAS WONDERING  WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE CITIES OF THE
LABOR CASTES AND MERCENARIES IN THE FORTRESSES

AS IF IN ANSWER  A GREAT SCREAMING ROAR WENT UP  DIM WITH DISTANCE 
PUNCTUATED WITH DETONATION AFTER DETONATION 

ITS THE FORTRESSES  HARTMAN SAID  GOD PITY THOSE THREE REGIMENTS

AT A CROSSING WE NOTICED  IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STOCKYARDS  A GIGANTIC
PILLAR OF SMOKE  AT THE NEXT CROSSING SEVERAL SIMILAR SMOKE PILLARS WERE
RISING SKYWARD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WEST SIDE  OVER THE CITY OF THE
MERCENARIES WE SAW A GREAT CAPTIVE WARBALLOON THAT BURST EVEN AS WE
LOOKED AT IT  AND FELL IN FLAMING WRECKAGE TOWARD THE EARTH  THERE WAS
NO CLEW TO THAT TRAGEDY OF THE AIR  WE COULD NOT DETERMINE WHETHER THE
BALLOON HAD BEEN MANNED BY COMRADES OR ENEMIES  A VAGUE SOUND CAME TO
OUR EARS  LIKE THE BUBBLING OF A GIGANTIC CALDRON A LONG WAY OFF  AND
HARTMAN SAID IT WAS MACHINEGUNS AND AUTOMATIC RIFLES 

AND STILL WE WALKED IN IMMEDIATE QUIETUDE  NOTHING WAS HAPPENING WHERE
WE WERE  THE POLICE AND THE AUTOMOBILE PATROLS WENT BY  AND ONCE HALF
A DOZEN FIREENGINES  RETURNING EVIDENTLY FROM SOME CONFLAGRATION  A
QUESTION WAS CALLED TO THE FIREMAN BY AN OFFICER IN AN AUTOMOBILE  AND
WE HEARD ONE SHOUT IN REPLY  NO WATER THEYVE BLOWN UP THE MAINS

WEVE SMASHED THE WATER SUPPLY  HARTMAN CRIED EXCITEDLY TO ME  IF WE
CAN DO ALL THIS IN A PREMATURE  ISOLATED  ABORTIVE ATTEMPT  WHAT CANT
WE DO IN A CONCERTED  RIPENED EFFORT ALL OVER THE LAND

THE AUTOMOBILE CONTAINING THE OFFICER WHO HAD ASKED THE QUESTION DARTED
ON  SUDDENLY THERE WAS A DEAFENING ROAR  THE MACHINE  WITH ITS HUMAN
FREIGHT  LIFTED IN AN UPBURST OF SMOKE  AND SANK DOWN A MASS OF WRECKAGE
AND DEATH 

HARTMAN WAS JUBILANT  WELL DONE WELL DONE HE WAS REPEATING  OVER
AND OVER  IN A WHISPER  THE PROLETARIAT GETS ITS LESSON TODAY  BUT IT
GIVES ONE  TOO 

POLICE WERE RUNNING FOR THE SPOT  ALSO  ANOTHER PATROL MACHINE HAD
HALTED  AS FOR MYSELF  I WAS IN A DAZE  THE SUDDENNESS OF IT WAS
STUNNING  HOW HAD IT HAPPENED I KNEW NOT HOW  AND YET I HAD BEEN
LOOKING DIRECTLY AT IT  SO DAZED WAS I FOR THE MOMENT THAT I WAS
SCARCELY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE WERE BEING HELD UP BY THE POLICE  I
ABRUPTLY SAW THAT A POLICEMAN WAS IN THE ACT OF SHOOTING HARTMAN  BUT
HARTMAN WAS COOL AND WAS GIVING THE PROPER PASSWORDS  I SAW THE LEVELLED
REVOLVER HESITATE  THEN SINK DOWN  AND HEARD THE DISGUSTED GRUNT OF THE
POLICEMAN  HE WAS VERY ANGRY  AND WAS CURSING THE WHOLE SECRET SERVICE 
IT WAS ALWAYS IN THE WAY  HE WAS AVERRING  WHILE HARTMAN WAS TALKING
BACK TO HIM AND WITH FITTING SECRETSERVICE PRIDE EXPLAINING TO HIM THE
CLUMSINESS OF THE POLICE 

THE NEXT MOMENT I KNEW HOW IT HAD HAPPENED  THERE WAS QUITE A GROUP
ABOUT THE WRECK  AND TWO MEN WERE JUST LIFTING UP THE WOUNDED OFFICER
TO CARRY HIM TO THE OTHER MACHINE  A PANIC SEIZED ALL OF THEM  AND
THEY SCATTERED IN EVERY DIRECTION  RUNNING IN BLIND TERROR  THE WOUNDED
OFFICER  ROUGHLY DROPPED  BEING LEFT BEHIND  THE CURSING POLICEMAN
ALONGSIDE OF ME ALSO RAN  AND HARTMAN AND I RAN  TOO  WE KNEW NOT WHY 
OBSESSED WITH THE SAME BLIND TERROR TO GET AWAY FROM THAT PARTICULAR
SPOT 

NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED THEN  BUT EVERYTHING WAS EXPLAINED  THE FLYING
MEN WERE SHEEPISHLY COMING BACK  BUT ALL THE WHILE THEIR EYES WERE
RAISED APPREHENSIVELY TO THE MANYWINDOWED  LOFTY BUILDINGS THAT TOWERED
LIKE THE SHEER WALLS OF A CANYON ON EACH SIDE OF THE STREET  FROM ONE
OF THOSE COUNTLESS WINDOWS THE BOMB HAD BEEN THROWN  BUT WHICH WINDOW
THERE HAD BEEN NO SECOND BOMB  ONLY A FEAR OF ONE 

THEREAFTER WE LOOKED WITH SPECULATIVE COMPREHENSION AT THE WINDOWS 
ANY OF THEM CONTAINED POSSIBLE DEATH  EACH BUILDING WAS A POSSIBLE
AMBUSCADE  THIS WAS WARFARE IN THAT MODERN JUNGLE  A GREAT CITY  EVERY
STREET WAS A CANYON  EVERY BUILDING A MOUNTAIN  WE HAD NOT CHANGED MUCH
FROM PRIMITIVE MAN  DESPITE THE WAR AUTOMOBILES THAT WERE SLIDING BY 

TURNING A CORNER  WE CAME UPON A WOMAN  SHE WAS LYING ON THE PAVEMENT 
IN A POOL OF BLOOD  HARTMAN BENT OVER AND EXAMINED HER  AS FOR MYSELF 
I TURNED DEATHLY SICK  I WAS TO SEE MANY DEAD THAT DAY  BUT THE TOTAL
CARNAGE WAS NOT TO AFFECT ME AS DID THIS FIRST FORLORN BODY LYING
THERE AT MY FEET ABANDONED ON THE PAVEMENT  SHOT IN THE BREAST  WAS
HARTMANS REPORT  CLASPED IN THE HOLLOW OF HER ARM  AS A CHILD MIGHT BE
CLASPED  WAS A BUNDLE OF PRINTED MATTER  EVEN IN DEATH SHE SEEMED LOATH
TO PART WITH THAT WHICH HAD CAUSED HER DEATH FOR WHEN HARTMAN HAD
SUCCEEDED IN WITHDRAWING THE BUNDLE  WE FOUND THAT IT CONSISTED OF LARGE
PRINTED SHEETS  THE PROCLAMATIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS 

A COMRADE  I SAID 

BUT HARTMAN ONLY CURSED THE IRON HEEL  AND WE PASSED ON  OFTEN WE
WERE HALTED BY THE POLICE AND PATROLS  BUT OUR PASSWORDS ENABLED US
TO PROCEED  NO MORE BOMBS FELL FROM THE WINDOWS  THE LAST PEDESTRIANS
SEEMED TO HAVE VANISHED FROM THE STREETS  AND OUR IMMEDIATE QUIETUDE
GREW MORE PROFOUND THOUGH THE GIGANTIC CALDRON CONTINUED TO BUBBLE IN
THE DISTANCE  DULL ROARS OF EXPLOSIONS CAME TO US FROM ALL DIRECTIONS 
AND THE SMOKEPILLARS WERE TOWERING MORE OMINOUSLY IN THE HEAVENS 



CHAPTER XXIII

THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS


SUDDENLY A CHANGE CAME OVER THE FACE OF THINGS  A TINGLE OF EXCITEMENT
RAN ALONG THE AIR  AUTOMOBILES FLED PAST  TWO  THREE  A DOZEN  AND FROM
THEM WARNINGS WERE SHOUTED TO US  ONE OF THE MACHINES SWERVED WILDLY
AT HIGH SPEED HALF A BLOCK DOWN  AND THE NEXT MOMENT  ALREADY LEFT WELL
BEHIND IT  THE PAVEMENT WAS TORN INTO A GREAT HOLE BY A BURSTING BOMB 
WE SAW THE POLICE DISAPPEARING DOWN THE CROSSSTREETS ON THE RUN  AND
KNEW THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE WAS COMING  WE COULD HEAR THE RISING ROAR
OF IT 

OUR BRAVE COMRADES ARE COMING  HARTMAN SAID 

WE COULD SEE THE FRONT OF THEIR COLUMN FILLING THE STREET FROM GUTTER TO
GUTTER  AS THE LAST WARAUTOMOBILE FLED PAST  THE MACHINE STOPPED FOR A
MOMENT JUST ABREAST OF US  A SOLDIER LEAPED FROM IT  CARRYING SOMETHING
CAREFULLY IN HIS HANDS  THIS  WITH THE SAME CARE  HE DEPOSITED IN THE
GUTTER  THEN HE LEAPED BACK TO HIS SEAT AND THE MACHINE DASHED ON  TOOK
THE TURN AT THE CORNER  AND WAS GONE FROM SIGHT  HARTMAN RAN TO THE
GUTTER AND STOOPED OVER THE OBJECT 

KEEP BACK  HE WARNED ME 

I COULD SEE HE WAS WORKING RAPIDLY WITH HIS HANDS  WHEN HE RETURNED TO
ME THE SWEAT WAS HEAVY ON HIS FOREHEAD 

I DISCONNECTED IT  HE SAID  AND JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME  THE SOLDIER
WAS CLUMSY  HE INTENDED IT FOR OUR COMRADES  BUT HE DIDNT GIVE IT
ENOUGH TIME  IT WOULD HAVE EXPLODED PREMATURELY  NOW IT WONT EXPLODE AT
ALL 

EVERYTHING WAS HAPPENING RAPIDLY NOW  ACROSS THE STREET AND HALF A BLOCK
DOWN  HIGH UP IN A BUILDING  I COULD SEE HEADS PEERING OUT  I HAD JUST
POINTED THEM OUT TO HARTMAN  WHEN A SHEET OF FLAME AND SMOKE RAN ALONG
THAT PORTION OF THE FACE OF THE BUILDING WHERE THE HEADS HAD APPEARED 
AND THE AIR WAS SHAKEN BY THE EXPLOSION  IN PLACES THE STONE FACING OF
THE BUILDING WAS TORN AWAY  EXPOSING THE IRON CONSTRUCTION BENEATH  THE
NEXT MOMENT SIMILAR SHEETS OF FLAME AND SMOKE SMOTE THE FRONT OF THE
BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET OPPOSITE IT  BETWEEN THE EXPLOSIONS WE COULD
HEAR THE RATTLE OF THE AUTOMATIC PISTOLS AND RIFLES  FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
THIS MIDAIR BATTLE CONTINUED  THEN DIED OUT  IT WAS PATENT THAT OUR
COMRADES WERE IN ONE BUILDING  THAT MERCENARIES WERE IN THE OTHER  AND
THAT THEY WERE FIGHTING ACROSS THE STREET  BUT WE COULD NOT TELL
WHICH WAS WHICHWHICH BUILDING CONTAINED OUR COMRADES AND WHICH THE
MERCENARIES 

BY THIS TIME THE COLUMN ON THE STREET WAS ALMOST ON US  AS THE FRONT OF
IT PASSED UNDER THE WARRING BUILDINGS  BOTH WENT INTO ACTION AGAINONE
BUILDING DROPPING BOMBS INTO THE STREET  BEING ATTACKED FROM ACROSS THE
STREET  AND IN RETURN REPLYING TO THAT ATTACK  THUS WE LEARNED WHICH
BUILDING WAS HELD BY OUR COMRADES  AND THEY DID GOOD WORK  SAVING THOSE
IN THE STREET FROM THE BOMBS OF THE ENEMY 

HARTMAN GRIPPED MY ARM AND DRAGGED ME INTO A WIDE ENTRANCE 

THEYRE NOT OUR COMRADES  HE SHOUTED IN MY EAR 

THE INNER DOORS TO THE ENTRANCE WERE LOCKED AND BOLTED  WE COULD NOT
ESCAPE  THE NEXT MOMENT THE FRONT OF THE COLUMN WENT BY  IT WAS NOT A
COLUMN  BUT A MOB  AN AWFUL RIVER THAT FILLED THE STREET  THE PEOPLE
OF THE ABYSS  MAD WITH DRINK AND WRONG  UP AT LAST AND ROARING FOR THE
BLOOD OF THEIR MASTERS  I HAD SEEN THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS BEFORE  GONE
THROUGH ITS GHETTOS  AND THOUGHT I KNEW IT BUT I FOUND THAT I WAS NOW
LOOKING ON IT FOR THE FIRST TIME  DUMB APATHY HAD VANISHED  IT WAS NOW
DYNAMICA FASCINATING SPECTACLE OF DREAD  IT SURGED PAST MY VISION IN
CONCRETE WAVES OF WRATH  SNARLING AND GROWLING  CARNIVOROUS  DRUNK WITH
WHISKEY FROM PILLAGED WAREHOUSES  DRUNK WITH HATRED  DRUNK WITH LUST
FOR BLOODMEN  WOMEN  AND CHILDREN  IN RAGS AND TATTERS  DIM FEROCIOUS
INTELLIGENCES WITH ALL THE GODLIKE BLOTTED FROM THEIR FEATURES AND ALL
THE FIENDLIKE STAMPED IN  APES AND TIGERS  ANAEMIC CONSUMPTIVES AND
GREAT HAIRY BEASTS OF BURDEN  WAN FACES FROM WHICH VAMPIRE SOCIETY HAD
SUCKED THE JUICE OF LIFE  BLOATED FORMS SWOLLEN WITH PHYSICAL GROSSNESS
AND CORRUPTION  WITHERED HAGS AND DEATHSHEADS BEARDED LIKE PATRIARCHS 
FESTERING YOUTH AND FESTERING AGE  FACES OF FIENDS  CROOKED  TWISTED 
MISSHAPEN MONSTERS BLASTED WITH THE RAVAGES OF DISEASE AND ALL THE
HORRORS OF CHRONIC INNUTRITIONTHE REFUSE AND THE SCUM OF LIFE  A
RAGING  SCREAMING  SCREECHING  DEMONIACAL HORDE 

AND WHY NOT THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS HAD NOTHING TO LOSE BUT THE MISERY
AND PAIN OF LIVING  AND TO GAINNOTHING  SAVE ONE FINAL  AWFUL GLUT OF
VENGEANCE  AND AS I LOOKED THE THOUGHT CAME TO ME THAT IN THAT RUSHING
STREAM OF HUMAN LAVA WERE MEN  COMRADES AND HEROES  WHOSE MISSION HAD
BEEN TO ROUSE THE ABYSMAL BEAST AND TO KEEP THE ENEMY OCCUPIED IN COPING
WITH IT 

AND NOW A STRANGE THING HAPPENED TO ME  A TRANSFORMATION CAME OVER ME 
THE FEAR OF DEATH  FOR MYSELF AND FOR OTHERS  LEFT ME  I WAS STRANGELY
EXALTED  ANOTHER BEING IN ANOTHER LIFE  NOTHING MATTERED  THE CAUSE FOR
THIS ONE TIME WAS LOST  BUT THE CAUSE WOULD BE HERE TOMORROW  THE
SAME CAUSE  EVER FRESH AND EVER BURNING  AND THEREAFTER  IN THE ORGY
OF HORROR THAT RAGED THROUGH THE SUCCEEDING HOURS  I WAS ABLE TO TAKE
A CALM INTEREST  DEATH MEANT NOTHING  LIFE MEANT NOTHING  I WAS AN
INTERESTED SPECTATOR OF EVENTS  AND  SOMETIMES SWEPT ON BY THE RUSH 
WAS MYSELF A CURIOUS PARTICIPANT  FOR MY MIND HAD LEAPED TO A STARCOOL
ALTITUDE AND GRASPED A PASSIONLESS TRANSVALUATION OF VALUES  HAD IT NOT
DONE THIS  I KNOW THAT I SHOULD HAVE DIED 

HALF A MILE OF THE MOB HAD SWEPT BY WHEN WE WERE DISCOVERED  A WOMAN
IN FANTASTIC RAGS  WITH CHEEKS CAVERNOUSLY HOLLOW AND WITH NARROW BLACK
EYES LIKE BURNING GIMLETS  CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HARTMAN AND ME  SHE
LET OUT A SHRILL SHRIEK AND BORE IN UPON US  A SECTION OF THE MOB TORE
ITSELF LOOSE AND SURGED IN AFTER HER  I CAN SEE HER NOW  AS I WRITE
THESE LINES  A LEAP IN ADVANCE  HER GRAY HAIR FLYING IN THIN TANGLED
STRINGS  THE BLOOD DRIPPING DOWN HER FOREHEAD FROM SOME WOUND IN THE
SCALP  IN HER RIGHT HAND A HATCHET  HER LEFT HAND  LEAN AND WRINKLED  A
YELLOW TALON  GRIPPING THE AIR CONVULSIVELY  HARTMAN SPRANG IN FRONT OF
ME  THIS WAS NO TIME FOR EXPLANATIONS  WE WERE WELL DRESSED  AND THAT
WAS ENOUGH  HIS FIST SHOT OUT  STRIKING THE WOMAN BETWEEN HER BURNING
EYES  THE IMPACT OF THE BLOW DROVE HER BACKWARD  BUT SHE STRUCK THE WALL
OF HER ONCOMING FELLOWS AND BOUNCED FORWARD AGAIN  DAZED AND HELPLESS 
THE BRANDISHED HATCHET FALLING FEEBLY ON HARTMANS SHOULDER 

THE NEXT MOMENT I KNEW NOT WHAT WAS HAPPENING  I WAS OVERBORNE BY THE
CROWD  THE CONFINED SPACE WAS FILLED WITH SHRIEKS AND YELLS AND CURSES 
BLOWS WERE FALLING ON ME  HANDS WERE RIPPING AND TEARING AT MY FLESH
AND GARMENTS  I FELT THAT I WAS BEING TORN TO PIECES  I WAS BEING BORNE
DOWN  SUFFOCATED  SOME STRONG HAND GRIPPED MY SHOULDER IN THE THICK OF
THE PRESS AND WAS DRAGGING FIERCELY AT ME  BETWEEN PAIN AND PRESSURE I
FAINTED  HARTMAN NEVER CAME OUT OF THAT ENTRANCE  HE HAD SHIELDED ME AND
RECEIVED THE FIRST BRUNT OF THE ATTACK  THIS HAD SAVED ME  FOR THE JAM
HAD QUICKLY BECOME TOO DENSE FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN THE MAD GRIPPING AND
TEARING OF HANDS 

I CAME TO IN THE MIDST OF WILD MOVEMENT  ALL ABOUT ME WAS THE SAME
MOVEMENT  I HAD BEEN CAUGHT UP IN A MONSTROUS FLOOD THAT WAS SWEEPING ME
I KNEW NOT WHITHER  FRESH AIR WAS ON MY CHEEK AND BITING SWEETLY IN MY
LUNGS  FAINT AND DIZZY  I WAS VAGUELY AWARE OF A STRONG ARM AROUND MY
BODY UNDER THE ARMS  AND HALFLIFTING ME AND DRAGGING ME ALONG  FEEBLY
MY OWN LIMBS WERE HELPING ME  IN FRONT OF ME I COULD SEE THE MOVING BACK
OF A MANS COAT  IT HAD BEEN SLIT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM ALONG THE CENTRE
SEAM  AND IT PULSED RHYTHMICALLY  THE SLIT OPENING AND CLOSING REGULARLY
WITH EVERY LEAP OF THE WEARER  THIS PHENOMENON FASCINATED ME FOR A TIME 
WHILE MY SENSES WERE COMING BACK TO ME  NEXT I BECAME AWARE OF STINGING
CHEEKS AND NOSE  AND COULD FEEL BLOOD DRIPPING ON MY FACE  MY HAT WAS
GONE  MY HAIR WAS DOWN AND FLYING  AND FROM THE STINGING OF THE SCALP I
MANAGED TO RECOLLECT A HAND IN THE PRESS OF THE ENTRANCE THAT HAD TORN
AT MY HAIR  MY CHEST AND ARMS WERE BRUISED AND ACHING IN A SCORE OF
PLACES 

MY BRAIN GREW CLEARER  AND I TURNED AS I RAN AND LOOKED AT THE MAN WHO
WAS HOLDING ME UP  HE IT WAS WHO HAD DRAGGED ME OUT AND SAVED ME  HE
NOTICED MY MOVEMENT 

ITS ALL RIGHT HE SHOUTED HOARSELY  I KNEW YOU ON THE INSTANT 

I FAILED TO RECOGNIZE HIM  BUT BEFORE I COULD SPEAK I TROD UPON
SOMETHING THAT WAS ALIVE AND THAT SQUIRMED UNDER MY FOOT  I WAS SWEPT ON
BY THOSE BEHIND AND COULD NOT LOOK DOWN AND SEE  AND YET I KNEW THAT IT
WAS A WOMAN WHO HAD FALLEN AND WHO WAS BEING TRAMPLED INTO THE PAVEMENT
BY THOUSANDS OF SUCCESSIVE FEET 

ITS ALL RIGHT  HE REPEATED  IM GARTHWAITE 

HE WAS BEARDED AND GAUNT AND DIRTY  BUT I SUCCEEDED IN REMEMBERING HIM
AS THE STALWART YOUTH THAT HAD SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS IN OUR GLEN ELLEN
REFUGE THREE YEARS BEFORE  HE PASSED ME THE SIGNALS OF THE IRON HEELS
SECRET SERVICE  IN TOKEN THAT HE  TOO  WAS IN ITS EMPLOY 

ILL GET YOU OUT OF THIS AS SOON AS I CAN GET A CHANCE  HE ASSURED ME 
BUT WATCH YOUR FOOTING  ON YOUR LIFE DONT STUMBLE AND GO DOWN 

ALL THINGS HAPPENED ABRUPTLY ON THAT DAY  AND WITH AN ABRUPTNESS THAT
WAS SICKENING THE MOB CHECKED ITSELF  I CAME IN VIOLENT COLLISION WITH
A LARGE WOMAN IN FRONT OF ME THE MAN WITH THE SPLIT COAT HAD VANISHED 
WHILE THOSE BEHIND COLLIDED AGAINST ME  A DEVILISH PANDEMONIUM
REIGNED SHRIEKS  CURSES  AND CRIES OF DEATH  WHILE ABOVE ALL ROSE THE
CHURNING RATTLE OF MACHINEGUNS AND THE PUTAPUT  PUTAPUT OF RIFLES 
AT FIRST I COULD MAKE OUT NOTHING  PEOPLE WERE FALLING ABOUT ME RIGHT
AND LEFT  THE WOMAN IN FRONT DOUBLED UP AND WENT DOWN  HER HANDS ON HER
ABDOMEN IN A FRENZIED CLUTCH  A MAN WAS QUIVERING AGAINST MY LEGS IN A
DEATHSTRUGGLE 

IT CAME TO ME THAT WE WERE AT THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN  HALF A MILE OF IT
HAD DISAPPEAREDWHERE OR HOW I NEVER LEARNED  TO THIS DAY I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT BECAME OF THAT HALFMILE OF HUMANITYWHETHER IT WAS BLOTTED OUT
BY SOME FRIGHTFUL BOLT OF WAR  WHETHER IT WAS SCATTERED AND DESTROYED
PIECEMEAL  OR WHETHER IT ESCAPED  BUT THERE WE WERE  AT THE HEAD OF THE
COLUMN INSTEAD OF IN ITS MIDDLE  AND WE WERE BEING SWEPT OUT OF LIFE BY
A TORRENT OF SHRIEKING LEAD 

AS SOON AS DEATH HAD THINNED THE JAM  GARTHWAITE  STILL GRASPING MY ARM 
LED A RUSH OF SURVIVORS INTO THE WIDE ENTRANCE OF AN OFFICE BUILDING 
HERE  AT THE REAR  AGAINST THE DOORS  WE WERE PRESSED BY A PANTING 
GASPING MASS OF CREATURES  FOR SOME TIME WE REMAINED IN THIS POSITION
WITHOUT A CHANGE IN THE SITUATION 

I DID IT BEAUTIFULLY  GARTHWAITE WAS LAMENTING TO ME  RAN YOU RIGHT
INTO A TRAP  WE HAD A GAMBLERS CHANCE IN THE STREET  BUT IN HERE
THERE IS NO CHANCE AT ALL  ITS ALL OVER BUT THE SHOUTING  VIVE LA
REVOLUTION

THEN  WHAT HE EXPECTED  BEGAN  THE MERCENARIES WERE KILLING WITHOUT
QUARTER  AT FIRST  THE SURGE BACK UPON US WAS CRUSHING  BUT AS THE
KILLING CONTINUED THE PRESSURE WAS EASED  THE DEAD AND DYING WENT DOWN
AND MADE ROOM  GARTHWAITE PUT HIS MOUTH TO MY EAR AND SHOUTED  BUT IN
THE FRIGHTFUL DIN I COULD NOT CATCH WHAT HE SAID  HE DID NOT WAIT  HE
SEIZED ME AND THREW ME DOWN  NEXT HE DRAGGED A DYING WOMAN OVER ON TOP
OF ME  AND  WITH MUCH SQUEEZING AND SHOVING  CRAWLED IN BESIDE ME AND
PARTLY OVER ME  A MOUND OF DEAD AND DYING BEGAN TO PILE UP OVER US  AND
OVER THIS MOUND  PAWING AND MOANING  CREPT THOSE THAT STILL SURVIVED 
BUT THESE  TOO  SOON CEASED  AND A SEMISILENCE SETTLED DOWN  BROKEN BY
GROANS AND SOBS AND SOUNDS OF STRANGULATION 

I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CRUSHED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR GARTHWAITE  AS IT WAS 
IT SEEMED INCONCEIVABLE THAT I COULD BEAR THE WEIGHT I DID AND LIVE  AND
YET  OUTSIDE OF PAIN  THE ONLY FEELING I POSSESSED WAS ONE OF CURIOSITY 
HOW WAS IT GOING TO END WHAT WOULD DEATH BE LIKE THUS DID I RECEIVE
MY RED BAPTISM IN THAT CHICAGO SHAMBLES  PRIOR TO THAT  DEATH TO ME HAD
BEEN A THEORY BUT EVER AFTERWARD DEATH HAS BEEN A SIMPLE FACT THAT DOES
NOT MATTER  IT IS SO EASY 

BUT THE MERCENARIES WERE NOT CONTENT WITH WHAT THEY HAD DONE  THEY
INVADED THE ENTRANCE  KILLING THE WOUNDED AND SEARCHING OUT THE UNHURT
THAT  LIKE OURSELVES  WERE PLAYING DEAD  I REMEMBER ONE MAN THEY DRAGGED
OUT OF A HEAP  WHO PLEADED ABJECTLY UNTIL A REVOLVER SHOT CUT HIM SHORT 
THEN THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO CHARGED FROM A HEAP  SNARLING AND SHOOTING 
SHE FIRED SIX SHOTS BEFORE THEY GOT HER  THOUGH WHAT DAMAGE SHE DID WE
COULD NOT KNOW  WE COULD FOLLOW THESE TRAGEDIES ONLY BY THE SOUND  EVERY
LITTLE WHILE FLURRIES LIKE THIS OCCURRED  EACH FLURRY CULMINATING IN THE
REVOLVER SHOT THAT PUT AN END TO IT  IN THE INTERVALS WE COULD HEAR
THE SOLDIERS TALKING AND SWEARING AS THEY RUMMAGED AMONG THE CARCASSES 
URGED ON BY THEIR OFFICERS TO HURRY UP 

AT LAST THEY WENT TO WORK ON OUR HEAP  AND WE COULD FEEL THE PRESSURE
DIMINISH AS THEY DRAGGED AWAY THE DEAD AND WOUNDED  GARTHWAITE BEGAN
UTTERING ALOUD THE SIGNALS  AT FIRST HE WAS NOT HEARD  THEN HE RAISED
HIS VOICE 

LISTEN TO THAT  WE HEARD A SOLDIER SAY  AND NEXT THE SHARP VOICE OF AN
OFFICER  HOLD ON THERE CAREFUL AS YOU GO

OH  THAT FIRST BREATH OF AIR AS WE WERE DRAGGED OUT GARTHWAITE DID THE
TALKING AT FIRST  BUT I WAS COMPELLED TO UNDERGO A BRIEF EXAMINATION TO
PROVE SERVICE WITH THE IRON HEEL 

AGENTSPROVOCATEURS ALL RIGHT  WAS THE OFFICERS CONCLUSION  HE WAS
A BEARDLESS YOUNG FELLOW  A CADET  EVIDENTLY  OF SOME GREAT OLIGARCH
FAMILY 

ITS A HELL OF A JOB  GARTHWAITE GRUMBLED  IM GOING TO TRY AND
RESIGN AND GET INTO THE ARMY  YOU FELLOWS HAVE A SNAP 

YOUVE EARNED IT  WAS THE YOUNG OFFICERS ANSWER  IVE GOT SOME PULL 
AND ILL SEE IF IT CAN BE MANAGED  I CAN TELL THEM HOW I FOUND YOU 

HE TOOK GARTHWAITES NAME AND NUMBER  THEN TURNED TO ME 

AND YOU

OH  IM GOING TO BE MARRIED  I ANSWERED LIGHTLY  AND THEN ILL BE OUT
OF IT ALL 

AND SO WE TALKED  WHILE THE KILLING OF THE WOUNDED WENT ON  IT IS ALL
A DREAM  NOW  AS I LOOK BACK ON IT BUT AT THE TIME IT WAS THE MOST
NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD  GARTHWAITE AND THE YOUNG OFFICER FELL INTO
AN ANIMATED CONVERSATION OVER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOCALLED MODERN
WARFARE AND THE PRESENT STREETFIGHTING AND SKYSCRAPER FIGHTING THAT
WAS TAKING PLACE ALL OVER THE CITY  I FOLLOWED THEM INTENTLY  FIXING UP
MY HAIR AT THE SAME TIME AND PINNING TOGETHER MY TORN SKIRTS  AND ALL
THE TIME THE KILLING OF THE WOUNDED WENT ON  SOMETIMES THE REVOLVER
SHOTS DROWNED THE VOICES OF GARTHWAITE AND THE OFFICER  AND THEY WERE
COMPELLED TO REPEAT WHAT THEY HAD BEEN SAYING 

I LIVED THROUGH THREE DAYS OF THE CHICAGO COMMUNE  AND THE VASTNESS OF
IT AND OF THE SLAUGHTER MAY BE IMAGINED WHEN I SAY THAT IN ALL THAT TIME
I SAW PRACTICALLY NOTHING OUTSIDE THE KILLING OF THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS
AND THE MIDAIR FIGHTING BETWEEN SKYSCRAPERS  I REALLY SAW NOTHING OF
THE HEROIC WORK DONE BY THE COMRADES  I COULD HEAR THE EXPLOSIONS OF
THEIR MINES AND BOMBS  AND SEE THE SMOKE OF THEIR CONFLAGRATIONS  AND
THAT WAS ALL  THE MIDAIR PART OF ONE GREAT DEED I SAW  HOWEVER  AND
THAT WAS THE BALLOON ATTACKS MADE BY OUR COMRADES ON THE FORTRESSES 
THAT WAS ON THE SECOND DAY  THE THREE DISLOYAL REGIMENTS HAD BEEN
DESTROYED IN THE FORTRESSES TO THE LAST MAN  THE FORTRESSES WERE CROWDED
WITH MERCENARIES  THE WIND BLEW IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION  AND UP WENT OUR
BALLOONS FROM ONE OF THE OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE CITY 

NOW BIEDENBACH  AFTER HE LEFT GLEN ELLEN  HAD INVENTED A MOST POWERFUL
EXPLOSIVEEXPEDITE HE CALLED IT  THIS WAS THE WEAPON THE BALLOONS
USED  THEY WERE ONLY HOTAIR BALLOONS  CLUMSILY AND HASTILY MADE  BUT
THEY DID THE WORK  I SAW IT ALL FROM THE TOP OF AN OFFICE BUILDING  THE
FIRST BALLOON MISSED THE FORTRESSES COMPLETELY AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE
COUNTRY BUT WE LEARNED ABOUT IT AFTERWARD  BURTON AND OSULLIVAN WERE
IN IT  AS THEY WERE DESCENDING THEY SWEPT ACROSS A RAILROAD DIRECTLY
OVER A TROOPTRAIN THAT WAS HEADING AT FULL SPEED FOR CHICAGO  THEY
DROPPED THEIR WHOLE SUPPLY OF EXPEDITE UPON THE LOCOMOTIVE  THE
RESULTING WRECK TIED THE LINE UP FOR DAYS  AND THE BEST OF IT WAS THAT 
RELEASED FROM THE WEIGHT OF EXPEDITE  THE BALLOON SHOT UP INTO THE
AIR AND DID NOT COME DOWN FOR HALF A DOZEN MILES  BOTH HEROES ESCAPING
UNHARMED 

THE SECOND BALLOON WAS A FAILURE  ITS FLIGHT WAS LAME  IT FLOATED TOO
LOW AND WAS SHOT FULL OF HOLES BEFORE IT COULD REACH THE FORTRESSES 
HERFORD AND GUINNESS WERE IN IT  AND THEY WERE BLOWN TO PIECES ALONG
WITH THE FIELD INTO WHICH THEY FELL  BIEDENBACH WAS IN DESPAIRWE HEARD
ALL ABOUT IT AFTERWARDAND HE WENT UP ALONE IN THE THIRD BALLOON  HE 
TOO  MADE A LOW FLIGHT  BUT HE WAS IN LUCK  FOR THEY FAILED SERIOUSLY TO
PUNCTURE HIS BALLOON  I CAN SEE IT NOW AS I DID THEN  FROM THE LOFTY TOP
OF THE BUILDINGTHAT INFLATED BAG DRIFTING ALONG THE AIR  AND THAT TINY
SPECK OF A MAN CLINGING ON BENEATH  I COULD NOT SEE THE FORTRESS  BUT
THOSE ON THE ROOF WITH ME SAID HE WAS DIRECTLY OVER IT  I DID NOT
SEE THE EXPEDITE FALL WHEN HE CUT IT LOOSE  BUT I DID SEE THE BALLOON
SUDDENLY LEAP UP INTO THE SKY  AN APPRECIABLE TIME AFTER THAT THE GREAT
COLUMN OF THE EXPLOSION TOWERED IN THE AIR  AND AFTER THAT  IN TURN  I
HEARD THE ROAR OF IT  BIEDENBACH THE GENTLE HAD DESTROYED A FORTRESS 
TWO OTHER BALLOONS FOLLOWED AT THE SAME TIME  ONE WAS BLOWN TO PIECES
IN THE AIR  THE EXPEDITE EXPLODING  AND THE SHOCK OF IT DISRUPTED THE
SECOND BALLOON  WHICH FELL PRETTILY INTO THE REMAINING FORTRESS 
IT COULDNT HAVE BEEN BETTER PLANNED  THOUGH THE TWO COMRADES IN IT
SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES 

BUT TO RETURN TO THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  MY EXPERIENCES WERE CONFINED
TO THEM  THEY RAGED AND SLAUGHTERED AND DESTROYED ALL OVER THE CITY
PROPER  AND WERE IN TURN DESTROYED BUT NEVER ONCE DID THEY SUCCEED IN
REACHING THE CITY OF THE OLIGARCHS OVER ON THE WEST SIDE  THE OLIGARCHS
HAD PROTECTED THEMSELVES WELL  NO MATTER WHAT DESTRUCTION WAS WREAKED IN
THE HEART OF THE CITY  THEY  AND THEIR WOMENKIND AND CHILDREN  WERE TO
ESCAPE HURT  I AM TOLD THAT THEIR CHILDREN PLAYED IN THE PARKS DURING
THOSE TERRIBLE DAYS AND THAT THEIR FAVORITE GAME WAS AN IMITATION OF
THEIR ELDERS STAMPING UPON THE PROLETARIAT 

BUT THE MERCENARIES FOUND IT NO EASY TASK TO COPE WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE
ABYSS AND AT THE SAME TIME FIGHT WITH THE COMRADES  CHICAGO WAS TRUE TO
HER TRADITIONS  AND THOUGH A GENERATION OF REVOLUTIONISTS WAS WIPED OUT 
IT TOOK ALONG WITH IT PRETTY CLOSE TO A GENERATION OF ITS ENEMIES 
OF COURSE  THE IRON HEEL KEPT THE FIGURES SECRET  BUT  AT A VERY
CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE  AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND
MERCENARIES WERE SLAIN  BUT THE COMRADES HAD NO CHANCE  INSTEAD OF THE
WHOLE COUNTRY BEING HAND IN HAND IN REVOLT  THEY WERE ALL ALONE  AND THE
TOTAL STRENGTH OF THE OLIGARCHY COULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTED AGAINST THEM
IF NECESSARY  AS IT WAS  HOUR AFTER HOUR  DAY AFTER DAY  IN ENDLESS
TRAINLOADS  BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS  THE MERCENARIES WERE HURLED INTO
CHICAGO 

AND THERE WERE SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS TIRING OF THE
SLAUGHTER  A GREAT HERDING MOVEMENT WAS BEGUN BY THE SOLDIERS  THE
INTENT OF WHICH WAS TO DRIVE THE STREET MOBS  LIKE CATTLE  INTO LAKE
MICHIGAN  IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS MOVEMENT THAT GARTHWAITE AND I
HAD ENCOUNTERED THE YOUNG OFFICER  THIS HERDING MOVEMENT WAS PRACTICALLY
A FAILURE  THANKS TO THE SPLENDID WORK OF THE COMRADES  INSTEAD OF THE
GREAT HOST THE MERCENARIES HAD HOPED TO GATHER TOGETHER  THEY SUCCEEDED
IN DRIVING NO MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND OF THE WRETCHES INTO THE LAKE 
TIME AND AGAIN  WHEN A MOB OF THEM WAS WELL IN HAND AND BEING DRIVEN
ALONG THE STREETS TO THE WATER  THE COMRADES WOULD CREATE A DIVERSION 
AND THE MOB WOULD ESCAPE THROUGH THE CONSEQUENT HOLE TORN IN THE
ENCIRCLING NET 

GARTHWAITE AND I SAW AN EXAMPLE OF THIS SHORTLY AFTER MEETING WITH THE
YOUNG OFFICER  THE MOB OF WHICH WE HAD BEEN A PART  AND WHICH HAD BEEN
PUT IN RETREAT  WAS PREVENTED FROM ESCAPING TO THE SOUTH AND EAST BY
STRONG BODIES OF TROOPS  THE TROOPS WE HAD FALLEN IN WITH HAD HELD IT
BACK ON THE WEST  THE ONLY OUTLET WAS NORTH  AND NORTH IT WENT TOWARD
THE LAKE  DRIVEN ON FROM EAST AND WEST AND SOUTH BY MACHINEGUN FIRE AND
AUTOMATICS  WHETHER IT DIVINED THAT IT WAS BEING DRIVEN TOWARD THE LAKE 
OR WHETHER IT WAS MERELY A BLIND SQUIRM OF THE MONSTER  I DO NOT KNOW
BUT AT ANY RATE THE MOB TOOK A CROSS STREET TO THE WEST  TURNED DOWN
THE NEXT STREET  AND CAME BACK UPON ITS TRACK  HEADING SOUTH TOWARD THE
GREAT GHETTO 

GARTHWAITE AND I AT THAT TIME WERE TRYING TO MAKE OUR WAY WESTWARD TO
GET OUT OF THE TERRITORY OF STREETFIGHTING  AND WE WERE CAUGHT RIGHT IN
THE THICK OF IT AGAIN  AS WE CAME TO THE CORNER WE SAW THE HOWLING MOB
BEARING DOWN UPON US  GARTHWAITE SEIZED MY ARM AND WE WERE JUST STARTING
TO RUN  WHEN HE DRAGGED ME BACK FROM IN FRONT OF THE WHEELS OF HALF A
DOZEN WAR AUTOMOBILES  EQUIPPED WITH MACHINEGUNS  THAT WERE RUSHING FOR
THE SPOT  BEHIND THEM CAME THE SOLDIERS WITH THEIR AUTOMATIC RIFLES 
BY THE TIME THEY TOOK POSITION  THE MOB WAS UPON THEM  AND IT LOOKED AS
THOUGH THEY WOULD BE OVERWHELMED BEFORE THEY COULD GET INTO ACTION 

HERE AND THERE A SOLDIER WAS DISCHARGING HIS RIFLE  BUT THIS SCATTERED
FIRE HAD NO EFFECT IN CHECKING THE MOB  ON IT CAME  BELLOWING WITH BRUTE
RAGE  IT SEEMED THE MACHINEGUNS COULD NOT GET STARTED  THE AUTOMOBILES
ON WHICH THEY WERE MOUNTED BLOCKED THE STREET  COMPELLING THE SOLDIERS
TO FIND POSITIONS IN  BETWEEN  AND ON THE SIDEWALKS  MORE AND MORE
SOLDIERS WERE ARRIVING  AND IN THE JAM WE WERE UNABLE TO GET AWAY 
GARTHWAITE HELD ME BY THE ARM  AND WE PRESSED CLOSE AGAINST THE FRONT OF
A BUILDING 

THE MOB WAS NO MORE THAN TWENTYFIVE FEET AWAY WHEN THE MACHINEGUNS
OPENED UP BUT BEFORE THAT FLAMING SHEET OF DEATH NOTHING COULD LIVE 
THE MOB CAME ON  BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE  IT PILED UP IN A HEAP  A
MOUND  A HUGE AND GROWING WAVE OF DEAD AND DYING  THOSE BEHIND URGED ON 
AND THE COLUMN  FROM GUTTER TO GUTTER  TELESCOPED UPON ITSELF  WOUNDED
CREATURES  MEN AND WOMEN  WERE VOMITED OVER THE TOP OF THAT AWFUL WAVE
AND FELL SQUIRMING DOWN THE FACE OF IT TILL THEY THRESHED ABOUT UNDER
THE AUTOMOBILES AND AGAINST THE LEGS OF THE SOLDIERS  THE LATTER
BAYONETED THE STRUGGLING WRETCHES  THOUGH ONE I SAW WHO GAINED HIS FEET
AND FLEW AT A SOLDIERS THROAT WITH HIS TEETH  TOGETHER THEY WENT DOWN 
SOLDIER AND SLAVE  INTO THE WELTER 

THE FIRING CEASED  THE WORK WAS DONE  THE MOB HAD BEEN STOPPED IN ITS
WILD ATTEMPT TO BREAK THROUGH  ORDERS WERE BEING GIVEN TO CLEAR THE
WHEELS OF THE WARMACHINES  THEY COULD NOT ADVANCE OVER THAT WAVE OF
DEAD  AND THE IDEA WAS TO RUN THEM DOWN THE CROSS STREET  THE SOLDIERS
WERE DRAGGING THE BODIES AWAY FROM THE WHEELS WHEN IT HAPPENED  WE
LEARNED AFTERWARD HOW IT HAPPENED  A BLOCK DISTANT A HUNDRED OF OUR
COMRADES HAD BEEN HOLDING A BUILDING  ACROSS ROOFS AND THROUGH BUILDINGS
THEY MADE THEIR WAY  TILL THEY FOUND THEMSELVES LOOKING DOWN UPON THE
CLOSEPACKED SOLDIERS  THEN IT WAS COUNTERMASSACRE 

WITHOUT WARNING  A SHOWER OF BOMBS FELL FROM THE TOP OF THE BUILDING 
THE AUTOMOBILES WERE BLOWN TO FRAGMENTS  ALONG WITH MANY SOLDIERS  WE 
WITH THE SURVIVORS  SWEPT BACK IN MAD RETREAT  HALF A BLOCK DOWN ANOTHER
BUILDING OPENED FIRE ON US  AS THE SOLDIERS HAD CARPETED THE STREET WITH
DEAD SLAVES  SO  IN TURN  DID THEY THEMSELVES BECOME CARPET  GARTHWAITE
AND I BORE CHARMED LIVES  AS WE HAD DONE BEFORE  SO AGAIN WE SOUGHT
SHELTER IN AN ENTRANCE  BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE CAUGHT NAPPING THIS TIME 
AS THE ROAR OF THE BOMBS DIED AWAY  HE BEGAN PEERING OUT 

THE MOBS COMING BACK HE CALLED TO ME  WEVE GOT TO GET OUT OF
THIS

WE FLED  HAND IN HAND  DOWN THE BLOODY PAVEMENT  SLIPPING AND SLIDING 
AND MAKING FOR THE CORNER  DOWN THE CROSS STREET WE COULD SEE A FEW
SOLDIERS STILL RUNNING  NOTHING WAS HAPPENING TO THEM  THE WAY WAS
CLEAR  SO WE PAUSED A MOMENT AND LOOKED BACK  THE MOB CAME ON SLOWLY 
IT WAS BUSY ARMING ITSELF WITH THE RIFLES OF THE SLAIN AND KILLING THE
WOUNDED  WE SAW THE END OF THE YOUNG OFFICER WHO HAD RESCUED US 
HE PAINFULLY LIFTED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW AND TURNED LOOSE WITH HIS
AUTOMATIC PISTOL 

THERE GOES MY CHANCE OF PROMOTION  GARTHWAITE LAUGHED  AS A WOMAN BORE
DOWN ON THE WOUNDED MAN  BRANDISHING A BUTCHERS CLEAVER  COME ON  ITS
THE WRONG DIRECTION  BUT WELL GET OUT SOMEHOW 

AND WE FLED EASTWARD THROUGH THE QUIET STREETS  PREPARED AT EVERY CROSS
STREET FOR ANYTHING TO HAPPEN  TO THE SOUTH A MONSTER CONFLAGRATION WAS
FILLING THE SKY  AND WE KNEW THAT THE GREAT GHETTO WAS BURNING  AT LAST
I SANK DOWN ON THE SIDEWALK  I WAS EXHAUSTED AND COULD GO NO FARTHER 
I WAS BRUISED AND SORE AND ACHING IN EVERY LIMB YET I COULD NOT ESCAPE
SMILING AT GARTHWAITE  WHO WAS ROLLING A CIGARETTE AND SAYING 

I KNOW IM MAKING A MESS OF RESCUING YOU  BUT I CANT GET HEAD NOR
TAIL OF THE SITUATION  ITS ALL A MESS  EVERY TIME WE TRY TO BREAK OUT 
SOMETHING HAPPENS AND WERE TURNED BACK  WERE ONLY A COUPLE OF BLOCKS
NOW FROM WHERE I GOT YOU OUT OF THAT ENTRANCE  FRIEND AND FOE ARE ALL
MIXED UP  ITS CHAOS  YOU CANT TELL WHO IS IN THOSE DARNED BUILDINGS 
TRY TO FIND OUT  AND YOU GET A BOMB ON YOUR HEAD  TRY TO GO PEACEABLY ON
YOUR WAY  AND YOU RUN INTO A MOB AND ARE KILLED BY MACHINEGUNS  OR
YOU RUN INTO THE MERCENARIES AND ARE KILLED BY YOUR OWN COMRADES FROM A
ROOF  AND ON THE TOP OF IT ALL THE MOB COMES ALONG AND KILLS YOU  TOO 

HE SHOOK HIS HEAD DOLEFULLY  LIGHTED HIS CIGARETTE  AND SAT DOWN BESIDE
ME 

AND IM THAT HUNGRY  HE ADDED  I COULD EAT COBBLESTONES 

THE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS ON HIS FEET AGAIN AND OUT IN THE STREET PRYING UP
A COBBLESTONE  HE CAME BACK WITH IT AND ASSAULTED THE WINDOW OF A STORE
BEHIND US 

ITS GROUND FLOOR AND NO GOOD  HE EXPLAINED AS HE HELPED ME THROUGH
THE HOLE HE HAD MADE BUT ITS THE BEST WE CAN DO  YOU GET A NAP AND
ILL RECONNOITRE  ILL FINISH THIS RESCUE ALL RIGHT  BUT I WANT TIME 
TIME  LOTS OF ITAND SOMETHING TO EAT 

IT WAS A HARNESS STORE WE FOUND OURSELVES IN  AND HE FIXED ME UP A COUCH
OF HORSE BLANKETS IN THE PRIVATE OFFICE WELL TO THE REAR  TO ADD TO MY
WRETCHEDNESS A SPLITTING HEADACHE WAS COMING ON  AND I WAS ONLY TOO GLAD
TO CLOSE MY EYES AND TRY TO SLEEP 

ILL BE BACK  WERE HIS PARTING WORDS  I DONT HOPE TO GET AN AUTO 
BUT ILL SURELY BRING SOME GRUB  ANYWAY 

      FOOD 

AND THAT WAS THE LAST I SAW OF GARTHWAITE FOR THREE YEARS  INSTEAD OF
COMING BACK  HE WAS CARRIED AWAY TO A HOSPITAL WITH A BULLET THROUGH HIS
LUNGS AND ANOTHER THROUGH THE FLESHY PART OF HIS NECK 



CHAPTER XXIV

NIGHTMARE


I HAD NOT CLOSED MY EYES THE NIGHT BEFORE ON THE TWENTIETH CENTURY  AND
WHAT OF THAT AND OF MY EXHAUSTION I SLEPT SOUNDLY  WHEN I FIRST AWOKE 
IT WAS NIGHT  GARTHWAITE HAD NOT RETURNED  I HAD LOST MY WATCH AND HAD
NO IDEA OF THE TIME  AS I LAY WITH MY EYES CLOSED  I HEARD THE SAME
DULL SOUND OF DISTANT EXPLOSIONS  THE INFERNO WAS STILL RAGING  I CREPT
THROUGH THE STORE TO THE FRONT  THE REFLECTION FROM THE SKY OF VAST
CONFLAGRATIONS MADE THE STREET ALMOST AS LIGHT AS DAY  ONE COULD HAVE
READ THE FINEST PRINT WITH EASE  FROM SEVERAL BLOCKS AWAY CAME THE
CRACKLE OF SMALL HANDBOMBS AND THE CHURNING OF MACHINEGUNS  AND FROM A
LONG WAY OFF CAME A LONG SERIES OF HEAVY EXPLOSIONS  I CREPT BACK TO MY
HORSE BLANKETS AND SLEPT AGAIN 

WHEN NEXT I AWOKE  A SICKLY YELLOW LIGHT WAS FILTERING IN ON ME  IT WAS
DAWN OF THE SECOND DAY  I CREPT TO THE FRONT OF THE STORE  A SMOKE PALL 
SHOT THROUGH WITH LURID GLEAMS  FILLED THE SKY  DOWN THE OPPOSITE
SIDE OF THE STREET TOTTERED A WRETCHED SLAVE  ONE HAND HE HELD TIGHTLY
AGAINST HIS SIDE  AND BEHIND HIM HE LEFT A BLOODY TRAIL  HIS EYES ROVED
EVERYWHERE  AND THEY WERE FILLED WITH APPREHENSION AND DREAD  ONCE HE
LOOKED STRAIGHT ACROSS AT ME  AND IN HIS FACE WAS ALL THE DUMB PATHOS
OF THE WOUNDED AND HUNTED ANIMAL  HE SAW ME  BUT THERE WAS NO KINSHIP
BETWEEN US  AND WITH HIM  AT LEAST  NO SYMPATHY OF UNDERSTANDING FOR
HE COWERED PERCEPTIBLY AND DRAGGED HIMSELF ON  HE COULD EXPECT NO AID
IN ALL GODS WORLD  HE WAS A HELOT IN THE GREAT HUNT OF HELOTS THAT THE
MASTERS WERE MAKING  ALL HE COULD HOPE FOR  ALL HE SOUGHT  WAS SOME HOLE
TO CRAWL AWAY IN AND HIDE LIKE ANY ANIMAL  THE SHARP CLANG OF A PASSING
AMBULANCE AT THE CORNER GAVE HIM A START  AMBULANCES WERE NOT FOR SUCH
AS HE  WITH A GROAN OF PAIN HE THREW HIMSELF INTO A DOORWAY  A MINUTE
LATER HE WAS OUT AGAIN AND DESPERATELY HOBBLING ON 

I WENT BACK TO MY HORSE BLANKETS AND WAITED AN HOUR FOR GARTHWAITE  MY
HEADACHE HAD NOT GONE AWAY  ON THE CONTRARY  IT WAS INCREASING  IT WAS
BY AN EFFORT OF WILL ONLY THAT I WAS ABLE TO OPEN MY EYES AND LOOK
AT OBJECTS  AND WITH THE OPENING OF MY EYES AND THE LOOKING CAME
INTOLERABLE TORMENT  ALSO  A GREAT PULSE WAS BEATING IN MY BRAIN  WEAK
AND REELING  I WENT OUT THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW AND DOWN THE STREET 
SEEKING TO ESCAPE  INSTINCTIVELY AND GROPINGLY  FROM THE AWFUL SHAMBLES 
AND THEREAFTER I LIVED NIGHTMARE  MY MEMORY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
SUCCEEDING HOURS IS THE MEMORY ONE WOULD HAVE OF NIGHTMARE  MANY EVENTS
ARE FOCUSSED SHARPLY ON MY BRAIN  BUT BETWEEN THESE INDELIBLE PICTURES
I RETAIN ARE INTERVALS OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS  WHAT OCCURRED IN THOSE
INTERVALS I KNOW NOT  AND NEVER SHALL KNOW 

I REMEMBER STUMBLING AT THE CORNER OVER THE LEGS OF A MAN  IT WAS THE
POOR HUNTED WRETCH THAT HAD DRAGGED HIMSELF PAST MY HIDINGPLACE  HOW
DISTINCTLY DO I REMEMBER HIS POOR  PITIFUL  GNARLED HANDS AS HE LAY
THERE ON THE PAVEMENTHANDS THAT WERE MORE HOOF AND CLAW THAN HANDS 
ALL TWISTED AND DISTORTED BY THE TOIL OF ALL HIS DAYS  WITH ON THE PALMS
A HORNY GROWTH OF CALLOUS A HALF INCH THICK  AND AS I PICKED MYSELF
UP AND STARTED ON  I LOOKED INTO THE FACE OF THE THING AND SAW THAT IT
STILL LIVED FOR THE EYES  DIMLY INTELLIGENT  WERE LOOKING AT ME AND
SEEING ME 

AFTER THAT CAME A KINDLY BLANK  I KNEW NOTHING  SAW NOTHING  MERELY
TOTTERED ON IN MY QUEST FOR SAFETY  MY NEXT NIGHTMARE VISION WAS A
QUIET STREET OF THE DEAD  I CAME UPON IT ABRUPTLY  AS A WANDERER IN THE
COUNTRY WOULD COME UPON A FLOWING STREAM  ONLY THIS STREAM I GAZED UPON
DID NOT FLOW  IT WAS CONGEALED IN DEATH  FROM PAVEMENT TO PAVEMENT  AND
COVERING THE SIDEWALKS  IT LAY THERE  SPREAD OUT QUITE EVENLY  WITH
ONLY HERE AND THERE A LUMP OR MOUND OF BODIES TO BREAK THE SURFACE  POOR
DRIVEN PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  HUNTED HELOTSTHEY LAY THERE AS THE RABBITS
IN CALIFORNIA AFTER A DRIVE  UP THE STREET AND DOWN I LOOKED  THERE WAS
NO MOVEMENT  NO SOUND  THE QUIET BUILDINGS LOOKED DOWN UPON THE SCENE
FROM THEIR MANY WINDOWS  AND ONCE  AND ONCE ONLY  I SAW AN ARM THAT
MOVED IN THAT DEAD STREAM  I SWEAR I SAW IT MOVE  WITH A STRANGE
WRITHING GESTURE OF AGONY  AND WITH IT LIFTED A HEAD  GORY WITH NAMELESS
HORROR  THAT GIBBERED AT ME AND THEN LAY DOWN AGAIN AND MOVED NO MORE 

      IN THOSE DAYS  SO SPARSELY POPULATED WAS THE LAND THAT
     WILD ANIMALS OFTEN BECAME PESTS   IN CALIFORNIA THE CUSTOM
     OF RABBITDRIVING OBTAINED   ON A GIVEN DAY ALL THE FARMERS
     IN A LOCALITY WOULD ASSEMBLE AND SWEEP ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN
     CONVERGING LINES  DRIVING THE RABBITS BY SCORES OF THOUSANDS
     INTO A PREPARED ENCLOSURE  WHERE THEY WERE CLUBBED TO DEATH
     BY MEN AND BOYS 

I REMEMBER ANOTHER STREET  WITH QUIET BUILDINGS ON EITHER SIDE  AND THE
PANIC THAT SMOTE ME INTO CONSCIOUSNESS AS AGAIN I SAW THE PEOPLE OF THE
ABYSS  BUT THIS TIME IN A STREAM THAT FLOWED AND CAME ON  AND THEN I SAW
THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR  THE STREAM MOVED SLOWLY  WHILE FROM IT AROSE
GROANS AND LAMENTATIONS  CURSINGS  BABBLINGS OF SENILITY  HYSTERIA  AND
INSANITY FOR THESE WERE THE VERY YOUNG AND THE VERY OLD  THE FEEBLE AND
THE SICK  THE HELPLESS AND THE HOPELESS  ALL THE WRECKAGE OF THE GHETTO 
THE BURNING OF THE GREAT GHETTO ON THE SOUTH SIDE HAD DRIVEN THEM FORTH
INTO THE INFERNO OF THE STREETFIGHTING  AND WHITHER THEY WENDED AND
WHATEVER BECAME OF THEM I DID NOT KNOW AND NEVER LEARNED 

      IT WAS LONG A QUESTION OF DEBATE  WHETHER THE BURNING OF
     THE SOUTH SIDE GHETTO WAS ACCIDENTAL  OR WHETHER IT WAS DONE
     BY THE MERCENARIES BUT IT IS DEFINITELY SETTLED NOW THAT
     THE GHETTO WAS FIRED BY THE MERCENARIES UNDER ORDERS FROM
     THEIR CHIEFS 

I HAVE FAINT MEMORIES OF BREAKING A WINDOW AND HIDING IN SOME SHOP TO
ESCAPE A STREET MOB THAT WAS PURSUED BY SOLDIERS  ALSO  A BOMB BURST
NEAR ME  ONCE  IN SOME STILL STREET  WHERE  LOOK AS I WOULD  UP AND
DOWN  I COULD SEE NO HUMAN BEING  BUT MY NEXT SHARP RECOLLECTION BEGINS
WITH THE CRACK OF A RIFLE AND AN ABRUPT BECOMING AWARE THAT I AM BEING
FIRED AT BY A SOLDIER IN AN AUTOMOBILE  THE SHOT MISSED  AND THE NEXT
MOMENT I WAS SCREAMING AND MOTIONING THE SIGNALS  MY MEMORY OF RIDING IN
THE AUTOMOBILE IS VERY HAZY  THOUGH THIS RIDE  IN TURN  IS BROKEN BY ONE
VIVID PICTURE  THE CRACK OF THE RIFLE OF THE SOLDIER SITTING BESIDE ME
MADE ME OPEN MY EYES  AND I SAW GEORGE MILFORD  WHOM I HAD KNOWN IN THE
PELL STREET DAYS  SINKING SLOWLY DOWN TO THE SIDEWALK  EVEN AS HE SANK
THE SOLDIER FIRED AGAIN  AND MILFORD DOUBLED IN  THEN FLUNG HIS BODY
OUT  AND FELL SPRAWLING  THE SOLDIER CHUCKLED  AND THE AUTOMOBILE SPED
ON 

THE NEXT I KNEW AFTER THAT I WAS AWAKENED OUT OF A SOUND SLEEP BY A MAN
WHO WALKED UP AND DOWN CLOSE BESIDE ME  HIS FACE WAS DRAWN AND STRAINED 
AND THE SWEAT ROLLED DOWN HIS NOSE FROM HIS FOREHEAD  ONE HAND WAS
CLUTCHED TIGHTLY AGAINST HIS CHEST BY THE OTHER HAND  AND BLOOD
DRIPPED DOWN UPON THE FLOOR AS HE WALKED  HE WORE THE UNIFORM OF THE
MERCENARIES  FROM WITHOUT  AS THROUGH THICK WALLS  CAME THE MUFFLED ROAR
OF BURSTING BOMBS  I WAS IN SOME BUILDING THAT WAS LOCKED IN COMBAT WITH
SOME OTHER BUILDING 

A SURGEON CAME IN TO DRESS THE WOUNDED SOLDIER  AND I LEARNED THAT IT
WAS TWO IN THE AFTERNOON  MY HEADACHE WAS NO BETTER  AND THE SURGEON
PAUSED FROM HIS WORK LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE ME A POWERFUL DRUG THAT WOULD
DEPRESS THE HEART AND BRING RELIEF  I SLEPT AGAIN  AND THE NEXT I KNEW I
WAS ON TOP OF THE BUILDING  THE IMMEDIATE FIGHTING HAD CEASED  AND I
WAS WATCHING THE BALLOON ATTACK ON THE FORTRESSES  SOME ONE HAD AN ARM
AROUND ME AND I WAS LEANING CLOSE AGAINST HIM  IT CAME TO ME QUITE AS A
MATTER OF COURSE THAT THIS WAS ERNEST  AND I FOUND MYSELF WONDERING HOW
HE HAD GOT HIS HAIR AND EYEBROWS SO BADLY SINGED 

IT WAS BY THE MEREST CHANCE THAT WE HAD FOUND EACH OTHER IN THAT
TERRIBLE CITY  HE HAD HAD NO IDEA THAT I HAD LEFT NEW YORK  AND  COMING
THROUGH THE ROOM WHERE I LAY ASLEEP  COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE THAT
IT WAS I  LITTLE MORE I SAW OF THE CHICAGO COMMUNE  AFTER WATCHING THE
BALLOON ATTACK  ERNEST TOOK ME DOWN INTO THE HEART OF THE BUILDING 
WHERE I SLEPT THE AFTERNOON OUT AND THE NIGHT  THE THIRD DAY WE SPENT
IN THE BUILDING  AND ON THE FOURTH  ERNEST HAVING GOT PERMISSION AND AN
AUTOMOBILE FROM THE AUTHORITIES  WE LEFT CHICAGO 

MY HEADACHE WAS GONE  BUT  BODY AND SOUL  I WAS VERY TIRED  I LAY BACK
AGAINST ERNEST IN THE AUTOMOBILE  AND WITH APATHETIC EYES WATCHED THE
SOLDIERS TRYING TO GET THE MACHINE OUT OF THE CITY  FIGHTING WAS
STILL GOING ON  BUT ONLY IN ISOLATED LOCALITIES  HERE AND THERE WHOLE
DISTRICTS WERE STILL IN POSSESSION OF THE COMRADES  BUT SUCH DISTRICTS
WERE SURROUNDED AND GUARDED BY HEAVY BODIES OF TROOPS  IN A HUNDRED
SEGREGATED TRAPS WERE THE COMRADES THUS HELD WHILE THE WORK OF
SUBJUGATING THEM WENT ON  SUBJUGATION MEANT DEATH  FOR NO QUARTER WAS
GIVEN  AND THEY FOUGHT HEROICALLY TO THE LAST MAN 

      NUMBERS OF THE BUILDINGS HELD OUT OVER A WEEK  WHILE ONE
     HELD OUT ELEVEN DAYS   EACH BUILDING HAD TO BE STORMED LIKE
     A FORT  AND THE MERCENARIES FOUGHT THEIR WAY UPWARD FLOOR BY
     FLOOR   IT WAS DEADLY FIGHTING   QUARTER WAS NEITHER GIVEN
     NOR TAKEN  AND IN THE FIGHTING THE REVOLUTIONISTS HAD THE
     ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABOVE   WHILE THE REVOLUTIONISTS WERE
     WIPED OUT  THE LOSS WAS NOT ONESIDED   THE PROUD CHICAGO
     PROLETARIAT LIVED UP TO ITS ANCIENT BOAST   FOR AS MANY OF
     ITSELF AS WERE KILLED  IT KILLED THAT MANY OF THE ENEMY 

WHENEVER WE APPROACHED SUCH LOCALITIES  THE GUARDS TURNED US BACK AND
SENT US AROUND  ONCE  THE ONLY WAY PAST TWO STRONG POSITIONS OF THE
COMRADES WAS THROUGH A BURNT SECTION THAT LAY BETWEEN  FROM EITHER SIDE
WE COULD HEAR THE RATTLE AND ROAR OF WAR  WHILE THE AUTOMOBILE PICKED
ITS WAY THROUGH SMOKING RUINS AND TOTTERING WALLS  OFTEN THE STREETS
WERE BLOCKED BY MOUNTAINS OF DEBRIS THAT COMPELLED US TO GO AROUND  WE
WERE IN A LABYRINTH OF RUIN  AND OUR PROGRESS WAS SLOW 

THE STOCKYARDS GHETTO  PLANT  AND EVERYTHING WERE SMOULDERING RUINS 
FAR OFF TO THE RIGHT A WIDE SMOKE HAZE DIMMED THE SKY THE TOWN OF
PULLMAN  THE SOLDIER CHAUFFEUR TOLD US  OR WHAT HAD BEEN THE TOWN OF
PULLMAN  FOR IT WAS UTTERLY DESTROYED  HE HAD DRIVEN THE MACHINE OUT
THERE  WITH DESPATCHES  ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE THIRD DAY  SOME OF THE
HEAVIEST FIGHTING HAD OCCURRED THERE  HE SAID  MANY OF THE STREETS BEING
RENDERED IMPASSABLE BY THE HEAPS OF THE DEAD 

SWINGING AROUND THE SHATTERED WALLS OF A BUILDING  IN THE STOCKYARDS
DISTRICT  THE AUTOMOBILE WAS STOPPED BY A WAVE OF DEAD  IT WAS FOR ALL
THE WORLD LIKE A WAVE TOSSED UP BY THE SEA  IT WAS PATENT TO US WHAT
HAD HAPPENED  AS THE MOB CHARGED PAST THE CORNER  IT HAD BEEN SWEPT  AT
RIGHT ANGLES AND POINTBLANK RANGE  BY THE MACHINEGUNS DRAWN UP ON THE
CROSS STREET  BUT DISASTER HAD COME TO THE SOLDIERS  A CHANCE BOMB MUST
HAVE EXPLODED AMONG THEM  FOR THE MOB  CHECKED UNTIL ITS DEAD AND DYING
FORMED THE WAVE  HAD WHITECAPPED AND FLUNG FORWARD ITS FOAM OF LIVING 
FIGHTING SLAVES  SOLDIERS AND SLAVES LAY TOGETHER  TORN AND MANGLED 
AROUND AND OVER THE WRECKAGE OF THE AUTOMOBILES AND GUNS 

ERNEST SPRANG OUT  A FAMILIAR PAIR OF SHOULDERS IN A COTTON SHIRT AND A
FAMILIAR FRINGE OF WHITE HAIR HAD CAUGHT HIS EYE  I DID NOT WATCH HIM 
AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE WAS BACK BESIDE ME AND WE WERE SPEEDING ON THAT
HE SAID 

IT WAS BISHOP MOREHOUSE 

SOON WE WERE IN THE GREEN COUNTRY  AND I TOOK ONE LAST GLANCE BACK AT
THE SMOKEFILLED SKY  FAINT AND FAR CAME THE LOW THUD OF AN EXPLOSION 
THEN I TURNED MY FACE AGAINST ERNESTS BREAST AND WEPT SOFTLY FOR THE
CAUSE THAT WAS LOST  ERNESTS ARM ABOUT ME WAS ELOQUENT WITH LOVE 

FOR THIS TIME LOST  DEAR HEART  HE SAID  BUT NOT FOREVER  WE HAVE
LEARNED  TOMORROW THE CAUSE WILL RISE AGAIN  STRONG WITH WISDOM AND
DISCIPLINE 

THE AUTOMOBILE DREW UP AT A RAILROAD STATION  HERE WE WOULD CATCH A
TRAIN TO NEW YORK  AS WE WAITED ON THE PLATFORM  THREE TRAINS THUNDERED
PAST  BOUND WEST TO CHICAGO  THEY WERE CROWDED WITH RAGGED  UNSKILLED
LABORERS  PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS 

SLAVELEVIES FOR THE REBUILDING OF CHICAGO  ERNEST SAID  YOU SEE  THE
CHICAGO SLAVES ARE ALL KILLED 



CHAPTER XXV

THE TERRORISTS


IT WAS NOT UNTIL ERNEST AND I WERE BACK IN NEW YORK  AND AFTER WEEKS HAD
ELAPSED  THAT WE WERE ABLE TO COMPREHEND THOROUGHLY THE FULL SWEEP OF
THE DISASTER THAT HAD BEFALLEN THE CAUSE  THE SITUATION WAS BITTER AND
BLOODY  IN MANY PLACES  SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY  SLAVE REVOLTS AND
MASSACRES HAD OCCURRED  THE ROLL OF THE MARTYRS INCREASED MIGHTILY 
COUNTLESS EXECUTIONS TOOK PLACE EVERYWHERE  THE MOUNTAINS AND WASTE
REGIONS WERE FILLED WITH OUTLAWS AND REFUGEES WHO WERE BEING HUNTED DOWN
MERCILESSLY  OUR OWN REFUGES WERE PACKED WITH COMRADES WHO HAD PRICES ON
THEIR HEADS  THROUGH INFORMATION FURNISHED BY ITS SPIES  SCORES OF OUR
REFUGES WERE RAIDED BY THE SOLDIERS OF THE IRON HEEL 

MANY OF THE COMRADES WERE DISHEARTENED  AND THEY RETALIATED WITH
TERRORISTIC TACTICS  THE SETBACK TO THEIR HOPES MADE THEM DESPAIRING
AND DESPERATE  MANY TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS UNAFFILIATED WITH US SPRANG
INTO EXISTENCE AND CAUSED US MUCH TROUBLE  THESE MISGUIDED PEOPLE
SACRIFICED THEIR OWN LIVES WANTONLY  VERY OFTEN MADE OUR OWN PLANS GO
ASTRAY  AND RETARDED OUR ORGANIZATION 

      THE ANNALS OF THIS SHORTLIVED ERA OF DESPAIR MAKE BLOODY
     READING   REVENGE WAS THE RULING MOTIVE  AND THE MEMBERS OF
     THE TERRORISTIC ORGANIZATIONS WERE CARELESS OF THEIR OWN
     LIVES AND HOPELESS ABOUT THE FUTURE   THE DANITES  TAKING
     THEIR NAME FROM THE AVENGING ANGELS OF THE MORMON MYTHOLOGY 
     SPRANG UP IN THE MOUNTAINS OF THE GREAT WEST AND SPREAD OVER
     THE PACIFIC COAST FROM PANAMA TO ALASKA   THE VALKYRIES WERE
     WOMEN   THEY WERE THE MOST TERRIBLE OF ALL   NO WOMAN WAS
     ELIGIBLE FOR MEMBERSHIP WHO HAD NOT LOST NEAR RELATIVES AT
     THE HANDS OF THE OLIGARCHY   THEY WERE GUILTY OF TORTURING
     THEIR PRISONERS TO DEATH   ANOTHER FAMOUS ORGANIZATION OF
     WOMEN WAS THE WIDOWS OF WAR   A COMPANION ORGANIZATION TO
     THE VALKYRIES WAS THE BERSERKERS   THESE MEN PLACED NO VALUE
     WHATEVER UPON THEIR OWN LIVES  AND IT WAS THEY WHO TOTALLY
     DESTROYED THE GREAT MERCENARY CITY OF BELLONA ALONG WITH ITS
     POPULATION OF OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS   THE BEDLAMITES
     AND THE HELLDAMITES WERE TWIN SLAVE ORGANIZATIONS  WHILE A
     NEW RELIGIOUS SECT THAT DID NOT FLOURISH LONG WAS CALLED THE
     WRATH OF GOD   AMONG OTHERS  TO SHOW THE WHIMSICALITY OF
     THEIR DEADLY SERIOUSNESS  MAY BE MENTIONED THE FOLLOWING 
     THE BLEEDING HEARTS  SONS OF THE MORNING  THE MORNING STARS 
     THE FLAMINGOES  THE TRIPLE TRIANGLES  THE THREE BARS  THE
     RUBONICS  THE VINDICATORS  THE COMANCHES  AND THE
     EREBUSITES 

AND THROUGH IT ALL MOVED THE IRON HEEL  IMPASSIVE AND DELIBERATE 
SHAKING UP THE WHOLE FABRIC OF THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN ITS SEARCH FOR
THE COMRADES  COMBING OUT THE MERCENARIES  THE LABOR CASTES  AND ALL ITS
SECRET SERVICES  PUNISHING WITHOUT MERCY AND WITHOUT MALICE  SUFFERING
IN SILENCE ALL RETALIATIONS THAT WERE MADE UPON IT  AND FILLING THE GAPS
IN ITS FIGHTING LINE AS FAST AS THEY APPEARED  AND HAND IN HAND WITH
THIS  ERNEST AND THE OTHER LEADERS WERE HARD AT WORK REORGANIZING THE
FORCES OF THE REVOLUTION  THE MAGNITUDE OF THE TASK MAY BE UNDERSTOOD
WHEN IT IS TAKEN INTO 

      THIS IS THE END OF THE EVERHARD MANUSCRIPT   IT BREAKS OFF
     ABRUPTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE   SHE MUST HAVE
     RECEIVED WARNING OF THE COMING OF THE MERCENARIES  FOR SHE
     HAD TIME SAFELY TO HIDE THE MANUSCRIPT BEFORE SHE FLED OR
     WAS CAPTURED   IT IS TO BE REGRETTED THAT SHE DID NOT LIVE
     TO COMPLETE HER NARRATIVE  FOR THEN  UNDOUBTEDLY  WOULD HAVE
     BEEN CLEARED AWAY THE MYSTERY THAT HAS SHROUDED FOR SEVEN
     CENTURIES THE EXECUTION OF ERNEST EVERHARD
